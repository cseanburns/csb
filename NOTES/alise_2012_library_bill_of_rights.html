  <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
  <p>When we attend to the Library Bill of Rights (LBR), we often attend
  to its ethical content—censorship, free expression, free access, no
  discrimination, and so forth— and what that ethical content implies.
  This paper differs in its focus. Rather than the content of the LBR,
  we are inspired by its grammar. Specifically, we focus on the
  grammatical <em>subject</em> of these policies, and in the LBR, this
  is primarily the term ‘libraries,’ and what it means for this kind of
  subject to do something, its action. Although we are not sure that the
  conventional term ‘libraries’ and its use in the LBR has the
  appropriate signifying capability, the subject and its action does
  motivate our study. In the preamble, the term ‘libraries’ is used to
  signify a place with a function— "libraries are forums for information
  and ideas"— and in the specific policies, the term ‘libraries’ is used
  to signify a moral agent— "libraries…should provide," "should
  challenge," "should cooperate" and so forth. Libraries are conceived
  of as moral agents, with special obligations and with the ability to
  form intentions and to act on those intentions. Our later purpose will
  be to question this usage, but presently it motivates a study of moral
  agency, specifically of intentionality and action, and because the
  term ‘libraries’ is in the plural, in that it signifies either
  libraries or librarians as collective entities, it motivates a study
  of libraries or librarians as collective moral agents.</p>
  <p>So this paper is not about practical reasoning—reasoning about
  ethical matters in order to devise a course of action. Practical
  reasoning about ethical content in LIS is well covered ground, and
  since the field is rife with significant ethical dilemmas (Fallis,
  2007), such as how to provide equitable information service, there is
  good reason to cover this ground in this way. For example, Robert
  Wengert (2001) notes the predominant attention to rights and
  corresponding responsibilities in library and information science, and
  we see this in important ethical discussions that utilize various
  ethical theories, such as deontology (Elgesem, 2008), social contract
  theory (Frické, Mathiesen, &amp; Fallis, 2000), utilitarianism (Doyle,
  2002), and discourse ethics (Budd, 2006).</p>
  <p>Instead, our focus is on the theoretical aspect of action, and this
  means shifting the discussion toward explanations of action.
  Essentially, some of the ethical dilemmas faced by library and
  informational professionals cannot easily be solved through practical
  reasoning alone. Questions that make ethical judgments possible, such
  as those about moral agency, intentionality, and action, need to be
  addressed. Someone who appeals to rights, for example, makes several
  assumptions about action and responsibility: that actions are
  performed by individual rights-bearers who are in contact with other
  individual rights-bearers, that actions have effects on people’s
  rights, and that moral agents are personally responsible for their
  effects on others. Such assumptions are not self-evidently true.
  Theoretical reasoning about action can help us to evaluate these
  claims, to see whether this is the correct understanding of the moral
  community— for example, whether we should adopt the rights tradition’s
  atomistic conception of moral agents and moral values, or whether we
  should accept the communitarian’s appeal to mutually transforming
  agents who are committed to a shared conception of the good. How we
  answer this question will have implications for what we decide to do
  and whom we ought to consider.</p>
  <p>Therefore, this paper asks the following research questions: What
  does action mean? What are the issues between individual and
  collective action? Is there justification for collective action, or
  collective moral agents, in librarianship?</p>
  <h2 id="the-need-for-corporate-responsibility">The Need for Corporate
  Responsibility</h2>
  <p>A number of philosophers have attempted to justify our ascription
  of agency to collective entities such as corporations, nations, clubs,
  and other organized groups. The apparent need for collective
  responsibility as an explanatory concept arises because of the
  diffusion of responsibility in bureaucratic organizations (Luban et
  al., 1992). Often groups take actions that cannot be attributed to any
  one member of the group, which means that either no one is
  responsible, which seems counterintuitive, or the group as a whole is
  responsible. In many circumstances, the business as a whole seems to
  be responsible for whatever happens: the business controls the
  earnings and is liable for any damages. It, and not individual
  employees, takes on the benefits and the burdens. Of course, malicious
  or negligent employees may be responsible in addition to or instead of
  the company as a whole. However, individuals cannot be identified in
  every case, and this necessitates the concept of collective
  responsibility.</p>
  <p>The ascription of agency to collective entities has both linguistic
  and legal warrants. It seems natural to us to talk about a company’s
  obligations to its employees and its customers. And if a corporation
  has a morally objectionable policy, we blame the company as a whole
  rather than particular employees. The policies remain even if the
  entire board of directors changes. So, consumers may boycott the
  company rather than getting angry at the executives themselves, or the
  particular managers who make investment and hiring decisions. The same
  is true under the law. Companies own property and pay taxes. They have
  rights, including (according to a recent Supreme Court decision) First
  Amendment rights to engage in political speech. They can be sued, and
  this does not necessarily involve suing the employees personally.
  Companies can be held legally responsible if their products harm
  consumers, if they damage the environment, or if they violate their
  employees’ right to organize.</p>
  <p>If corporations can be held legally responsible, then it seems that
  they must be capable of moral agency as well. Even if there were no
  laws to minimize harms to the environment or ensure the proper
  treatment of workers, the company could still coerce its employees or
  poison the local water supply, and doing so would be morally wrong
  despite the lack of legal regulations. Richard De George (1983)
  claims, responsibility in both senses, legally and morally, amounts to
  the same thing. However, corporations do not have all of the
  characteristics that typical moral agents have. De George mentions
  moral feelings, but they also lack other psychological “events” such
  as desires, and they certainly have no Cartesian soul that gives rise
  to physical behavior. But they perform actions, and since, in the
  legal context, we trace those actions to collective entities that
  perform them, we ought to be able to do the same thing in the moral
  context.</p>
  <p>To be morally and legally responsible, however, a collective entity
  must not only act but must also have the characteristics that are
  typically attributed to individual agents, according to which their
  actions are attributed to them. First of all, an agent’s actions must
  result from his or her intentions<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref"
  id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>. When this connection
  is absent, the person is neither praised nor blamed. For a collective
  entity to be an agent, the intentions of the particular individuals
  must be united somehow such that the corporation has a collective
  intention that causes it to act. That is, there must be a decision
  procedure in place that people follow as members of the group in order
  for their individual decisions to result in a corporate action. In a
  business setting, Peter French (1979 and 1984) calls this organizing
  principle a corporate internal decision (CID) structure. Employees’
  intentions and actions are absorbed by the organization, which can
  then be said to decide and act as a collective agent, resulting in a
  corporate decision (see also Donaldson, 1982, pp. 30-32). Without such
  a unifying decision procedure, there is no collective intention.</p>
  <p>For the purposes of this paper, however, we set aside the question
  of whether collective responsibility is possible in any general case.
  Here we are interested in whether a library meets the requirements
  that have been established by defenders of collective responsibility
  —that is, whether it is more like a corporation with a unifying
  decision procedure, or whether it is a loose collection of agents
  whose individual intentions are not organized into a group decision.
  The course of that analysis involves an examination of what it means
  to be a professional, which severely complicates the possibility of
  collective responsibility.</p>
  <h2 id="intentionality-and-action">Intentionality and Action</h2>
  <p>Although the concept of collective responsibility has been widely
  accepted and used by business ethicists, other philosophers have
  expressed reservations about the idea because the nature of
  intentionality complicates the "individuation of actions" (Chant,
  2006, p. 422).</p>
  <p>First, if an agent is to be held responsible for what he or she
  does, then we need an explanatory causal link between intention and
  action. Donald Davidson’s (1980) analysis shows that such explanations
  make actions intelligible and differentiate them from events. Simply
  put, an action requires a proper and reasonable explanation via its
  intention. This is accomplished via logical causation, as opposed to
  some empirical cause, which would have a predictive, material
  relation.</p>
  <p>Scholarship in library ethics employs this distinction in analyzing
  decisions made by librarians. For example, in the seminal article "Not
  Censorship But Selection," Lester Asheim (1953) shows that although
  selection and censorship may both result in the same outcome— namely,
  the non-inclusion of some work for the collection— the intent (or
  motive) differs in the two cases, and thus we must assess them
  differently.</p>
  <p>Intentionality, then, seems to be a key component in explaining and
  assessing actions, but it leads to the individual and collective
  action problem. If we require intent from an agent to say that the
  agent acted, then we face the problem of describing how groups of
  agents could share intentions in collective action cases (see Copp,
  2007; and Ludwig, 2007). If individual agents can share intentions in
  some way, then they may be able to act as a collective. Consequently,
  we could assign blame or praise to the collective for its action.
  However, if agents cannot share intentions, then we must find an
  explanation that traces responsibility to particular agents within the
  collective.</p>
  <p>One popular response to this problem is the summative account of
  collective intentions, according to which "add up" to individual
  intentions of group members to determine the group intention. On this
  view, if the individuals have the same intention and (in some
  accounts) know they have the same intention, and each of the group
  members acts on that intention, then they constitute a collective
  agent. John Searle (1990) illustrates how an appeal to collective
  intentions, in this way, is unnecessary and misleading: Suppose a
  class of students have just received their master's degrees from
  Library School X, where they learned about the important values of the
  profession, such as the freedom to read, and each student intends to
  defend those values because they believe that such values lead to the
  good life, in all its ethical understanding, or a good society. Searle
  argues that we can reduce their supposedly collective intention to a
  series of I-intentions with beliefs added and therefore they do not
  form true collective intentionality. That is, <em>each</em> of the
  graduates intends to advance the values of the profession, but
  <em>all</em> of the graduates together do not have one unified
  intention, understood as a collective mental state giving rise to
  action (even if we could make sense of what that means).</p>
  <p>Following the work of Kenneth Arrow (1950) and of Christian List
  and Philip Pettit (2004), Sara Chant (2010) illustrates an additional
  collective intentionality dilemma, which we can also modify to suit a
  library example. The example highlights the tension between individual
  and collective intentions, the diffusion of responsibility, and it
  raises questions about the mesh between individual and collective
  intentionality and rationality. Imagine that a book containing X
  material is challenged by a group in a particular library’s community.
  In response, the library board must decide whether the book should be
  removed or kept. To make this decision, they must vote on the case’s
  propositions, which are:</p>
  <ol type="1">
  <li>Library books that contain X material should be removed.</li>
  <li>Book A contains X material.</li>
  <li>Book A should be removed.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>The propositions set up a rationality constraint so that if (1) and
  (2) are accepted, then (3) must be accepted since it logically
  follows. Suppose the board members have discussed the case and
  outlined their judgments in the following, individually rational
  way:</p>
  <p>Board member Amy agrees with the first two propositions and so
  agrees with the last proposition, that Book A should be removed. Board
  member Ben agrees that Book A contains X material, but he does not
  agree that such books should be removed and so does not agree that
  Book A should be removed. Board member Cindy agrees that books that
  contain X material should be removed, but she does not agree that Book
  A contains X material and so does not agree that Book A should be
  removed. All three of these sets of beliefs are internally consistent
  and rational.</p>
  <p>In such a case, it would be perfectly realistic for the board to
  vote on each proposition in what may be called a "‘premise-centered’
  approach to judgment aggregation" (Chant, 2010, p. 13). First, board
  members Amy, Ben, and Cindy consider the first proposition and
  conclude in a 2-1 vote in favor of proposition (1), that "Library
  books that contain X material should be removed." Likewise, the board
  members arrive at the same conclusion for proposition (2), that "Book
  A contains X material." However, when they consider proposition (3),
  they vote 2-1 against removing Book A, even though as a board they
  voted for the first two propositions. Given that (3) follows logically
  from (1) and (2), it seems that the board should collectively come to
  the conclusion that Book A should be removed, even though they in fact
  conclude that it should not be removed (Figure 1).</p>

  <h2 id="ethics-and-agency">Ethics and Agency</h2>
  <p>Taking all of the above into consideration, we find in
  librarianship two ways to view (potential) collective entities as
  responsible agents, but neither of which is ultimately defensible.
  What makes the issue problematic is professional status, which creates
  a tension between individual and collective identity.</p>
  <p>First, we may want to hold a library responsible for some action.
  For example, if Public Library X succumbs to pressure to remove a
  controversial book, then we might want to blame Public Library X as a
  whole for such an action, rather than some individual librarian or
  board member. Second, since librarians as a profession oppose
  censorship, and yet if some librarians censor, we may want to fault
  something about the profession—the profession has failed in some
  way.</p>
  <p>Collective responsibility in the first case depends on the
  organizational structure of a library. In the second case, it depends
  on its professional status (described by Abbott, 1998; Goode, 1957),
  or what unites a group of people who are engaged in the same type of
  activity. There are insurmountable conceptual difficulties with
  attributing responsibility either to libraries or to librarians as a
  whole. First, because of the professional status of librarians,
  libraries do not have the unifying structure that would make them
  collectively responsible organizational units; and second, there is a
  tension between independence/autonomy and collectivity that both
  unites and divides people who are pursuing a common profession.</p>
  <p>The previous two approaches are interdependent, but there is also a
  tension between holding a collective entity such as a library
  responsible and blaming a profession rather than (or in addition to) a
  member of that profession. In fact, the expertise that someone has by
  being a professional seems to undermine the attribution of collective
  agency to libraries (in fact, it may even have a causal effect on the
  organizational structure of libraries). For example, we may be
  justified in blaming a specific librarian for removing a controversial
  book from the shelves, rather than blaming the library as a whole
  (including the staff and the library’s governing board), because we
  consider him or her to be a qualified person to make the decision (and
  thus more responsible for it), and because of that qualification,
  would be able to formulate a proper explanation of her action. For
  example, we may be justified for holding morally responsible a
  specific medical doctor, rather than all doctors at a particular
  office, for a particular kind of malpractice because we consider that
  specific doctor a professional and because of the organizational
  structure of that doctor’s office (more horizontal than top-down).
  This makes the status of being a "professional," or profession-hood,
  problematic for assigning collective responsibility— because being a
  professional means having increased responsibility in general for the
  skills and attitudes of what it means to be a professional—that is, it
  entails a level of independence. At the same time, one is a
  professional in a profession. That is, profession-hood is bestowed
  (authorized, legitimized) by the professional collective; becoming a
  professional is a collective act and so implies a collective identity.
  José Ortega y Gasset (1961) articulates how this is so in his paper on
  "The Mission of the Librarian," which defines a profession as that
  which is a collective necessity (see pp. 136-138). Doctors are doctors
  because they undergo a certain kind of education and training, and
  because they receive the attitudes and identity of the profession in
  this process. If one doctor retires, the profession continues; yet if
  all doctors retire, the profession expires. Such an extreme constrains
  this individual and collective issue.</p>
  <h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
  <p>In this presentation, I have explained the seeming need for
  collective responsibility in library ethics, but I have also pointed
  out some of the conceptual difficulties that we face in trying to make
  sense of it. In a larger version of this paper, my coauthor and I
  grapple with these issues—that is, we try to figure out if library
  ethicists can construe libraries and librarians in such a way that
  documents such as the Library Bill of Rights apply to them. We are
  doubtful that this can be accomplished, and so we conclude that the
  LBR needs to be revised to apply to specific moral agents rather than
  collectives. There is a lot of work to be done here, and I know that
  this presentation has only begun the inquiry. But I welcome your
  questions and suggestions as we continue to explore this topic.</p>
