              <h2>An Essay with ChatGPT on Dystopian Fiction</h2>

              <p>Last year (2023) I read Kazuo Ishiguro's "Never Let Me Go".
              It haunted me just like Cormac McCarthy's "The Road" haunted me when I read that 15 years ago.
              I don't read dystopian fiction that much, because I don't like being haunted in this way,
              but these novels did more than disturb me.
              Although both dystopian, they contrast in interesting ways.
              And I immediately wanted to be in a book club to discuss these two works.</p>

              <p>Alas, I'm not in a book club.
              But since I was really curious about their shared dystopian-ness and struck by how they contrasted in plot,
              themes, characters, and more, I went to ChatGPT.
              I proposed a theory that the differences between these two works are based on the Britishness of Ishiguro and
              on the Americanness of McCarthy, specifically, the American Westerness of McCarthy.
              So I prepped ChatGPT with a few questions about these works and then proposed this thesis to it.
              The eventual result was the following essay, which I asked ChatGPT to write based on my thesis and our discussions.</p>

                  <h3 style="text-align:center;">A Comparative Study of 'Never Let Me Go' and 'The Road'</h3>
                  <p style="text-align:center;"><time datetime="2023-11-19">November 19, 2023</time></p>

                  <h3>Introduction</h3>

                  <p>In the realm of dystopian literature,
                  few works stand as poignantly divergent as Kazuo Ishiguro's <cite>Never Let Me Go</cite> and
                  Cormac McCarthy's <cite>The Road</cite>.
                  Both novels paint bleak futures, yet they approach their narratives with distinct thematic focuses and
                  stylistic choices that reflect their authors' cultural backgrounds.
                  Ishiguro, with his British heritage,
                  delves into themes of societal compliance and
                  emotional resilience through a narrative of quiet resignation and introspective conflict.
                  This contrasts sharply with McCarthy's American perspective,
                  which emphasizes individual struggle and physical resilience against a hostile, post-apocalyptic environment.
                  These two novels not only highlight the impact of national literary traditions on dystopian fiction
                  but also present fundamentally different character responses to their dystopian realities.
                  <cite>Never Let Me Go</cite> focuses on characters contending with their societal roles and existential acceptance,
                  while <cite>The Road</cite> portrays a more active struggle against external threats,
                  underscoring the authors' unique takes on human agency and survival informed by their cultural and literary heritages.</p>

                  <h3>Cultural Backgrounds and Thematic Focus</h3>

                  <p>Kazuo Ishiguro's <cite>Never Let Me Go</cite> is steeped in the British literary tradition of social critique and
                  character introspection.
                  The novel unfolds in a version of England where human clones are raised to be organ donors,
                  a fate the protagonists passively accept.
                  This acceptance is not a sign of weakness but a portrayal of a deeply ingrained societal conditioning,
                  a theme prevalent in British literature.
                  It reflects a society's power to shape individual identity and destiny,
                  a subject explored by British authors from Charles Dickens to George Orwell.
                  In contrast, Cormac McCarthy's <cite>The Road</cite> is rooted in the American ethos of survival against environmental and
                  societal collapse.
                  Set in a post-apocalyptic America, the narrative follows a father and son as they navigate a desolate landscape,
                  beset by threats both natural and human.
                  This emphasis on individual struggle against external forces echoes the American literary tradition of man versus nature,
                  as seen in the works of Jack London and John Steinbeck.
                  McCarthy’s depiction of a world where societal structures have disintegrated aligns
                  with the American distrust of authority and the valorization of self-reliance.</p>

                  <h3>Emotional Resilience and Societal Compliance in 'Never Let Me Go'</h3>

                  <p>In <cite>Never Let Me Go</cite>,
                  Ishiguro explores the emotional landscape of characters who internalize and accept the societal role imposed upon them.
                  The protagonists, Kathy, Tommy, and Ruth, are raised in a seemingly idyllic boarding school, Hailsham,
                  only to gradually uncover the grim truth of their existence as clones created for organ donation.
                  Unlike typical dystopian protagonists, they do not rebel or flee;
                  instead, they navigate their limited existence with a poignant sense of acceptance and introspection.
                  This internalization of their fate reflects the power of societal norms in shaping individual destinies,
                  a recurrent theme in British literature.
                  Ishiguro's narrative, thus, becomes a subtle critique of societal complacency and the dangers of unchallenged conformity.
                  The emotional resilience of the characters in the face of such existential despair speaks volumes about the human condition,
                  a testament to the strength found in quiet acceptance and the depth of introspection.</p>

                  <h3>Physical Resilience and Survival in "The Road"</h3>

                  <p>Contrastingly, McCarthy's <cite>The Road</cite> is a relentless portrayal of physical and
                  moral resilience in a hostile world.
                  The father and son, the central characters,
                  are on a perpetual quest for survival in a landscape ravaged by an unspecified cataclysm.
                  Their journey is marked by constant threats - scarcity of food, the peril of other survivors, and
                  the harshness of the environment.
                  McCarthy’s narrative is less about societal critique and more about the human spirit's capacity to endure and protect.
                  The father's determination to safeguard his son, even in the face of insurmountable odds,
                  encapsulates the American ideal of rugged individualism and the fight against adversity.
                  This struggle against external forces is emblematic of the American literary tradition,
                  where the narrative often revolves around characters confronting and overcoming external challenges.</p>

                  <h3>Different Approaches to Human Agency and Survival</h3>


                  <p>The differing approaches of Ishiguro and McCarthy to human agency and
                  survival in their respective dystopian settings are striking.
                  In <cite>Never Let Me Go</cite>, the characters exhibit a form of agency that is introspective and resigned.
                  Their actions are less about changing their world and more about finding meaning within it.
                  This reflects a more British inclination towards understanding one's place in a larger social structure,
                  resonating with the literary tradition of social realism.
                  On the other hand, <cite>The Road</cite> emphasizes active agency,
                  where survival itself becomes an act of defiance against the cruel world.
                  The characters' relentless push forward, their unwavering will to live, and protect each other,
                  are distinctly American traits,
                  echoing the country's frontier spirit and the valorization of the individual against the odds.</p>

                  <h3>The Central Role of Despair in Dystopian Fiction</h3>

                  <p>Despite the varied responses of the characters in both novels,
                  what unifies <cite>Never Let Me Go</cite> and <cite>The Road</cite> within the dystopian genre
                  is the pervasive presence of despair.
                  Dystopian literature, by its very nature, conjures worlds steeped in pessimism and hopelessness, and
                  both Ishiguro and McCarthy harness this essence effectively, albeit in different ways.
                  In <cite>Never Let Me Go</cite>,
                  despair is rooted in the inescapable fate of the characters and their gradual realization of it.
                  The quiet acceptance of their destinies by Kathy, Tommy, and Ruth
                  underscores a deep-seated sense of hopelessness about the possibility of altering their circumstances.
                  This is a despair that is emotional, existential, and reflective, characteristic of a dystopia that is more societal and
                  psychological.</p>

                  <p>In contrast, <cite>The Road</cite> presents despair as a constant companion in a world
                  that has lost all semblance of order and normalcy.
                  The bleakness of the post-apocalyptic landscape, the constant threat of death, and
                  the struggle for basic survival imbue the narrative with a visceral sense of despair.
                  However, unlike <cite>Never Let Me Go</cite>, where despair leads to resignation, in <cite>The Road</cite>,
                  it fuels the determination to survive.
                  The characters' resilience in the face of such desolation highlights a different aspect of despair in dystopian settings –
                  one that drives the fight for life against all odds.</p>

                  <p>This duality in the portrayal of despair – 
                  as a force leading to resignation in one and resilience in the other – 
                  exemplifies the versatility of the dystopian genre.
                  It showcases how despair, a central element in dystopian narratives,
                  can be interpreted and manifested differently by authors, informed by their cultural contexts and literary traditions.</p>

                  <h3>Conclusion</h3>

                  <p>In conclusion, <cite>Never Let Me Go</cite> by Kazuo Ishiguro and <cite>The Road</cite> by Cormac McCarthy
                  present two distinct visions of dystopian realities,
                  each deeply influenced by their respective authors' cultural backgrounds.
                  Ishiguro's British perspective brings forth a narrative of societal conditioning and emotional introspection,
                  while McCarthy's American viewpoint portrays a relentless struggle against environmental and societal collapse.
                  Both novels, despite their differences, remain true to the dystopian genre's essence,
                  using despair as a central theme to explore human resilience and vulnerability.
                  Through their unique approaches to character development, thematic exploration, and narrative style,
                  Ishiguro and McCarthy contribute profoundly to the dystopian genre,
                  offering insightful commentaries on the human condition under extreme circumstances.
                  Their works stand not only as compelling narratives but also as reflections of the cultural and
                  literary traditions that shaped them,
                  highlighting the diverse possibilities within dystopian fiction.</p>
