    <h1>Preface:</h1>
    <h2>An Essay with ChatGPT on The Causes of Monsters</h2>

    <p>Two things: first, I've long been fascinated by how authors, filmmakers, and others depict the causes of certain kinds of monsters,
    especially the kinds of monsters that have long dominated the cultural west (e.g., vampires, werewolves, zombies).
    Second, I have also been interested in how adaptable these monsters have been over time, with respect to their causes.
    When I grew up, most of these monsters had some kind of religious or supernatural cause for their origins, but as I grew older,
    I found that the people who created these monsters would embed faux-scientific explanations for their origins instead.
    E.g., Vampires and such had viral or genetic causes instead of supernatural ones.</p>

    <p>The turning point seemed to take place in the 1980s, which for a while depicted some of these monsters without causes.
    This is why in the essay below, I asked ChatGPT to give those versions some treatment, and
    it came up with the idea of subcultures.</p>

    <p>My main thesis, which I asked ChatGPT to expand upon in essay form, was that the shifting origins
    of these monsters was due to societal changes.
    As my country (US) became more secular, so did its monsters.
    There's a counterargument not addressed in the essay below.
    It's the simple idea that the shifting explanation for the causes of these monsters simply reflects a certain kind of affordance.
    That is, because we could come up with faux scientific explanations for these monsters,
    creators came up with the respective faux scientific explanations.
    However, there are lots of monsters that have not been so adaptable.
    They are too supernatural in their core identity, and because of that, they are less adaptable to secular reasons for their origins,
    and because of that, I don't think they are as well represented in modern fiction (e.g., the Jinn).</p>

    <p>We also did not discuss ghosts.
    But these could be explained by my thesis, too.
    There are a number of television shows, movies, etc that have depicted ghosts as lost souls of some kind.
    But they have also been depicted as having non-supernatural essences, and I think this will continue.
    For example, I can imagine a future work depicting a disembodied AI as a kind of ghost.</p>

    <p>Last note: I asked ChatGPT to give <em>Frankenstein</em> some treatment here, too.
    The monster, I think, represents an early precursor to the faux-scientific explanations of monsters in the century that followed it.
    And interestingly, it was a monster that was often lumped in with other supernatural monsters in some of the movies that I watched
    when I was a kid in the 70s.
    It therefore had a kind of supernatural tinge to it even though it didn't have a supernatural cause,
    but as we discussed in our chat, Frankenstein's monster does have religious themes.</p>

    You'll notice that I asked ChatGPT to revise the essay a few times:

    <h2 style="text-align:center;">Monsters and Their Evolution:</h2>
    <h3 style="text-align:center;">From Judeo-Christian Origins to Secularization in the Atomic and Space Age</h3>
    <p style="text-align:center;"><time datetime="2024-08-09">August 9, 2024</time></p>

    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    
    <p>Monsters have long been a powerful symbol in storytelling, reflecting humanity's deepest fears and cultural anxieties.
    Traditional monsters such as vampires, werewolves, and zombies have origins deeply rooted in Judeo-Christian beliefs,
    often serving as embodiments of sin, evil, or divine punishment.
    However, the 20th century brought about significant cultural shifts—marked by the rise of scientific rationalism,
    the atomic age, and the space race—that influenced not only the creation of new monsters with secular origins
    but also reshaped the narratives of those with religious beginnings.
    Amidst these changes,
    Mary Shelley’s <em>Frankenstein</em> stands out as a pivotal work that straddles the line between religious and secular understandings of monsters,
    offering a unique commentary on the ethical implications of scientific progress.
    This essay explores the evolution of monsters from religious origins to secularization,
    with a focus on the adaptability of traditional monsters, the impact of the atomic and space age, and
    the role of <em>Frankenstein</em> as a cornerstone in the secularization narrative.</p>
    
    <h3>Monsters as Manifestations of Sin and Divine Punishment</h3>
    
    <p>Many of the most enduring monsters in Western culture, such as vampires, werewolves, and zombies,
    originally emerged from a world deeply influenced by Judeo-Christian beliefs.
    In their earliest forms, these monsters were often portrayed as manifestations of sin, evil, or divine punishment,
    serving as warnings about the dangers of moral transgression.</p>

    <p>Vampires, for example, were traditionally seen as undead beings cursed by God, damned to an eternity of bloodlust and darkness.
    Their vulnerability to holy symbols such as crosses and holy water underscored their connection to Christian beliefs about
    sin, redemption, and the power of faith.
    Similarly, werewolves were often depicted as humans cursed to transform into wolves as a result of sinful behavior or pacts with the devil.
    This transformation symbolized a loss of humanity and a surrender to animalistic instincts,
    reflecting religious fears about the consequences of moral degradation.
    Zombies, with origins in Haitian folklore, were depicted as reanimated corpses controlled by dark magic or sorcery.
    Though not directly tied to Judeo-Christian beliefs, their portrayal as mindless, soulless beings
    resonated with religious fears of demonic possession and the loss of the soul.</p>

    <p>These monsters served as potent reminders of the spiritual dangers that awaited those who strayed from the path of righteousness.
    They were not just physical threats but moral and spiritual ones, embodying the consequences of sin and the power of divine retribution.</p>

    <h3>The Secularization of Monsters in the Atomic and Space Age</h3>

    <p>The 20th century brought about a dramatic shift in the way monsters were portrayed,
    driven by the rise of scientific rationalism and the anxieties of the atomic and space age.
    These new cultural contexts gave rise to monsters rooted in secular fears—such as nuclear fallout and extraterrestrial threats—which,
    in turn, influenced the way traditional monsters were understood and depicted.</p>

    <p>One of the most iconic monsters to emerge from the atomic age was Godzilla,
    first introduced in 1954. Godzilla, a creature awakened and mutated by nuclear radiation,
    served as a powerful metaphor for the devastating power of nuclear weapons.
    Its origins were distinctly secular,
    reflecting fears of scientific hubris and the potential for humanity to unleash destructive forces beyond its control.
    Similarly, the post-World War II era saw a proliferation of movies featuring mutants and giant insects, such as <em>Them!</em> (1954),
    where radiation from nuclear tests led to monstrous transformations.
    These creatures represented the fear of radiation and the unknown consequences of scientific experimentation,
    marking a shift from supernatural to secular origins.</p>

    <p>The space age also introduced new fears, particularly the fear of extraterrestrial threats.
    <em>The Blob</em> (1958), a creature from outer space that consumes everything in its path,
    symbolized the fear of the unknown and the uncontrollable nature of space.
    Unlike earlier monsters with religious connotations, The Blob's threat was purely secular.
    Ridley Scott’s <em>Alien</em> (1979) further exemplified this trend,
    introducing an extraterrestrial predator with no religious or supernatural origins.
    The fear it evoked was based on its biological superiority and predatory nature,
    reflecting anxieties about the potential dangers of space exploration and the unknown horrors that might lurk beyond Earth.</p>

    <p>These new monsters were born from the scientific advancements and existential fears of the 20th century,
    reflecting a shift in cultural anxieties from spiritual to secular concerns.
    They embodied the dangers of technology, the consequences of scientific experimentation,
    and the fear of the unknown, whether in the form of nuclear fallout or alien invasions.</p>

    <h3>The Adaptability of Traditional Monsters</h3>

    <p>Despite the rise of new, secular monsters in the 20th century,
    traditional monsters such as vampires, werewolves, and zombies have remained remarkably robust and adaptable.
    These monsters, originally rooted in religious narratives, have evolved to fit modern contexts,
    maintaining their relevance in a rapidly changing world.</p>

    <p>Vampires, for instance, have been reimagined in ways that align with contemporary fears and scientific understanding.
    While originally explained through curses and divine punishment,
    modern portrayals often present vampirism as a result of viral infections or genetic mutations.
    This shift is evident in films like <em>Blade</em> (1998) and <em>Underworld</em> (2003),
    where vampirism is depicted as a biological condition rather than a supernatural curse.
    This adaptability has allowed vampires to remain compelling figures in popular culture,
    capable of reflecting both ancient fears of death and contemporary anxieties about disease and genetic manipulation.</p>

    <p>Werewolves have similarly transitioned from being cursed by supernatural forces to being explained through genetic anomalies or diseases.
    In modern narratives, lycanthropy is often depicted as a hereditary condition or a virus, blending psychological and biological elements.
    This shift mirrors the concerns of the atomic age, where mutations and inherited traits became central to understanding monstrous transformations.
    The werewolf’s adaptability lies in its ability to represent the duality of human nature,
    the struggle between civilization and savagery, and
    the fear of losing control—themes that remain relevant in both religious and secular contexts.</p>

    <p>Zombies have undergone perhaps the most dramatic transformation,
    evolving from beings controlled by dark magic to the result of viral outbreaks or scientific experiments.
    This shift is epitomized in films like <em>28 Days Later</em> (2002) and <em>World War Z</em> (2013),
    where the fear of zombies is rooted in the fear of pandemics and societal collapse.
    The adaptability of zombies as symbols of contagion and chaos has allowed them to remain relevant across different cultural contexts.
    Whether portrayed as products of supernatural forces or as the result of scientific disasters,
    zombies continue to embody fears about the breakdown of social order, the spread of disease, and the loss of humanity.</p>

    <p>The ability of these traditional monsters to evolve and adapt to new contexts is a testament to their enduring power.
    Despite their religious origins, they have remained relevant by reflecting the changing fears and anxieties of each era,
    from spiritual concerns to scientific and technological ones.</p>

    <h3><em>Frankenstein</em>: A Foundational Secular Monster with Religious Undertones</h3>

    <p>While the secularization of monsters became more pronounced in the 20th century,
    Mary Shelley’s <em>Frankenstein</em>, published in 1818, stands as a foundational text in this evolution.
    <em>Frankenstein</em> is unique in that it presents a monster created through scientific means rather than supernatural forces,
    yet it also retains significant religious and moral undertones, making it a pivotal work in the history of monster narratives.</p>

    <p>In <em>Frankenstein</em>, Victor Frankenstein uses scientific experimentation to reanimate dead tissue,
    creating life without divine intervention.
    This act of creation is distinctly secular,
    reflecting the early 19th-century fascination with the possibilities of science and the potential
    for humans to push the boundaries of what was previously considered sacred.
    Frankenstein's monster is born from human ingenuity rather than divine power,
    marking a significant departure from the religious origins of earlier monsters.
    However, despite its secular creation, <em>Frankenstein</em> is deeply imbued with religious and moral themes.
    Victor’s attempt to "play God" by creating life leads to tragic consequences,
    serving as a cautionary tale about the dangers of scientific hubris and the ethical responsibilities that come with scientific advancement.
    The novel explores themes of guilt, responsibility, and the consequences of defying natural order,
    reflecting both religious and secular anxieties about the limits of human knowledge and power.</p>

    <p><em>Frankenstein</em> serves as a counterpoint in the narrative of secularization,
    blending scientific creation with religious and moral undertones.
    While it prefigures the secularization of monsters by presenting a creature born from science,
    it also highlights the enduring relevance of religious and ethical concerns in the face of scientific progress.
    In this way, <em>Frankenstein</em> bridges the gap between the supernatural origins of monsters and their modern,
    scientifically-grounded counterparts, offering a complex commentary on the cultural and ethical implications of scientific advancement.</p>

    <h3>Subcultures and Monsters with No Explicit Origins</h3>

    <p>In addition to the secularization of monsters,
    the late 20th and early 21st centuries saw the rise of subcultures that embraced these creatures as symbols of identity and rebellion,
    often stripping them of their original contexts and focusing less on their origins.</p>

    <p>The goth subculture, which emerged in the late 1970s and early 1980s, embraced vampires, werewolves, and other monsters as symbols of darkness,
    mystery, and the outsider.
    In goth culture, these monsters are often detached from their religious or secular origins and instead
    become icons of individualism and resistance against mainstream norms.
    The lack of focus on origin stories in this context reflects a broader cultural shift toward personal interpretation and identity formation.</p>

    <p>Similarly, in punk and post-apocalyptic subcultures,
    zombies and mutants are often used to symbolize societal decay and the failure of modern civilization.
    These monsters serve as metaphors for the breakdown of order and the chaos that ensues,
    with less emphasis on their origins and more on their role in representing societal collapse and resistance to authority.
    In these subcultures, monsters become symbols of cultural identity, representing the fears, values, and aspirations of those who embrace them.</p>

    <h3>Monsters, Fear, and Cultural Identity</h3>

    <p>The evolution of monsters from religious origins to secular beings reflects not only changing sources of fear
    but also broader questions of cultural identity.
    Monsters have always been a way to externalize and confront societal anxieties,
    serving as symbols that help us understand our place in the world.</p>

    <p>Whether rooted in religious beliefs or scientific advancements,
    monsters allow us to explore the boundaries of what it means to be human,
    the dangers of overstepping those boundaries, and the consequences of our actions.
    As society has moved away from religious explanations,
    the focus has shifted to fears about technology, disease, and the unknown,
    reflecting a more secular and scientifically-oriented worldview.</p>

    <p>Beyond fear, monsters have become powerful symbols of cultural identity.
    Subcultures that embrace these creatures often do so as a way to express alternative identities,
    challenge societal norms, and create a sense of belonging.
    Whether through the goth embrace of the vampire or the punk adoption of the zombie,
    monsters serve as vehicles for exploring and asserting cultural identity,
    often detached from their original contexts and reinterpreted in ways that resonate with contemporary values.</p>

    <h3>Conclusion: The Enduring Power of Monsters in a Changing World</h3>

    <p>The evolution of monsters from their Judeo-Christian origins to their secular incarnations in the atomic and space age
    reflects broader societal changes and the shifting sources of fear in the modern world.
    While new monsters with secular origins emerged in the 20th century,
    traditional monsters like vampires, werewolves, and zombies have remained remarkably robust and adaptable,
    evolving to fit contemporary contexts and maintain their relevance.</p>

    <p><em>Frankenstein</em> stands as a pivotal work in this evolution,
    offering a complex blend of secular creation and religious undertones that continues to resonate with modern audiences.
    As both a precursor to the secularization of monsters and a cautionary tale about the ethical implications of scientific advancement,
    <em>Frankenstein</em> highlights the enduring relevance of monsters in exploring the human condition.</p>

    <p>Ultimately, monsters serve not only as reflections of our deepest fears but also as symbols of cultural identity,
    offering a powerful means of exploring and confronting the anxieties and ethical dilemmas of each era.
    As society continues to evolve, so too will our monsters,
    adapting to new contexts and continuing to challenge our understanding of what it means to be human.</p>
