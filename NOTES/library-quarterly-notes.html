The Scholarly Journal and Disciplinary Identity: An Autoethnographic
Reading of The Library Quarterly</h1>
<p><strong>Note on this abstract:</strong></p>
<p>This is an abstract I submitted to <a
href="http://www.alise.org/">ALISE</a> for the <a
href="http://www.alise.org/2014-conference">2014 conference</a>. I won’t
know if it will be accepted for a couple more months (It was accepted),
and since it’s not a double peer blind review process, I see no problem
posting it now.</p>
<p>I’m posting this abstract for a specific reason. This site will
function as a place for my field notes on the project. Since I’m about
to add my first set of notes, it seems important to explain the reason
for those notes, before I begin posting them, in case the process might
be useful to someone.</p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> After the following abstract was reviewed
and before final submission to the conference, I made some revisions to
the following text. See my <a
href="https://github.com/seancsb/research-notebook">GitHub
repository</a> for the previous version.</p>
<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Scholarly journals play important roles in the dissemination of
information and knowledge. However, beginning with the early days of
science, journals have had other forms of influence (Price, 1986;
Hunter, 2010). In particular, journals have contributed to the “building
of scientific communities” (Functions of Scientific Journals section,
para 3, Schaffner, 1994), and this has been true for the field we now
call library and information science (LIS).</p>
<p>In the LIS example, the journal has played an important role in
identity formation since the founding of the <em>Library Journal</em> in
1876. Approximately 55 years later, the founding of several scholarly
and technical journals, including <em>The Library Quarterly</em> (1931),
the <em>Journal of Documentary Reproduction</em> (1938), which would
later and in a roundabout way evolve into <em>JASIS&amp;T</em>
(Farkas-Conn, 1990), and <em>College and Research Libraries</em> (1939),
created additional outlets for the “publication of professional
problems” (Hamlin, p. 60, 1981). For Hamlin, the addition of these
journals signified a decade of wonders for librarians. In general,
though, they helped usher in modern librarianship, evolve areas such as
information science from documentation, and provide a cultural record of
the efforts made by the people involved – something to refer to and to
identify with as members of a community.</p>
<h2 id="methodology">Methodology</h2>
<p>This study employs an autoethnographic reading of the first four
volumes of the <em>The Library Quarterly</em> (LQ). This includes a
reading of 16 issues and 120 articles published in the 1931 through 1934
volumes. In this study, the autoethnographic approach involves
describing what it means to be a researcher and an educator in a field
where scholarly journals played an important role in shaping the
identity of the field. The goal is twofold: to develop a richer
understanding of what journals mean for our professional identity, and
to develop a framework that will enable future research of how other
disciplines were shaped by journals.</p>
<p>Autoethnography is the chosen research design because the act of
examining a LIS journal, in its role as an identity shaper, is the
self-conscious and reflexive act of a participant observer (Ellis,
Adams, &amp; Bochner, 2011) – that is, a member of the community who is
studying the community and its history. Two versions of autoethnographic
research have been developed: evocative autoethnography and analytic
autoethnography. Evocative autoethnography emphasizes “evocation as a
goal, for one, and writing narratively, for another” (Ellis &amp;
Bochner, p. 432, 2006). Analytical autoethnography, like its evocative
counterpart, “seeks narrative fidelity [… and] is grounded in
self-experience but reaches beyond it as well” (Anderson, p. 386, 2006).
Since one purpose of this study is to understand, broadly, how journals
have contributed to disciplinary identity, analytical autoethnography is
the chosen research design.</p>
<p>Autoethnographic research in LIS is rare (e.g., Michels, 2012) and
autoethnographic readings of texts may be more common but are rare also.
Kaufmann’s (2005) “autotheoretical [sic] reading of Foucault” (p. 577)
provides a reference point for this study. In that study, Kaufmann
interrupts her</p>
<blockquote>
theoretical interpretations of Foucault with autoethnographic pieces,
textual vignettes of my life gathered through journal entries and books
read [… which] function as illustrations and / or counterpoints to my
summary of Foucault’s theories (p. 577).
</blockquote>
<p>Inspired by Kaufmann (2005), this study functions as an
autohistorical, rather than an autotheoretical, reading of LQ. By this I
mean I will include historical interpretations, grounded in readings of
our field’s literature, of the first 120 articles in LQ with textual
reflections of my experiences as a new researcher and educator within
LIS. Since data will be collected in this way, my field notes will be
public and accessible at <a
href="https://cseanburns.net/wiki/lq/background">https://cseanburns.net/wiki/lq/background</a>.</p>
<h1 id="motivation">Motivation</h1>
<p>The motivation for this study originates from recent scholarly
communication trends and what these trends mean for the sciences,
broadly defined. Specifically, despite the important role journals have
had in creating communities and shaping identities, problems associated
with the serials crisis and developments in emerging technologies have
resulted in some researchers calling for an end to the genre. The
arguments include a move to the article as a complete product in itself
and to a market-based, decentralized infrastructure (Priem &amp;
Hemminger, 2012) where identification, publication, storage, assessment,
marketing, search, and preparation are taken over by entities other than
the journal (Priem, 2013).</p>
<p>In some cases, re-envisioned publishing models are challenging the
traditional journal genre, too. PeerJ, for example, is a recent open
access platform that charges authors a small, one time fee. The relevant
requirement is that all authors assume peer review duties at least once
per year (Van Noorden, 2012). Furthermore, the platform publishes on a
continuous basis and is not dependent on publishing actual serials. That
is, articles are published soon after and subsequent to peer review and
acceptance.</p>
<p>Whether the rhetoric exhibited among the proponents of these trends
is convincing, the arguments valid, or the outcomes overwhelmingly
desired by the people involved in research activities, it is true that
many researchers are becoming more interested in adopting new
dissemination technologies (Tatum &amp; Jankowski, 2013) or are required
to communicate their data, their products, and their reports in more
comprehensive ways (Piwowar, 2013).</p>
<p>Though the journal’s end time is not likely near, these interests and
requirements are already having a disruptive influence on the scholarly
communication system (Cope &amp; Kalantzis, 2009), which will have an
increasingly dynamic future. Also, while adoption of radical new methods
of communication may be more appropriate for some forms of science, the
state of affairs does beg for reflection on what the journal has done
for community. In the process, it will be important to know, if
anything, is lost for the culture of science if the journal is
eventually dismissed.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Note: I removed the next few passages in the final submission
of the conference abstract. But the idea expressed below remains an
important part of the project:</strong></p>
<p>Another aspect to consider is that an extreme focus on the article’s
importance, at the cost of the journal’s, suggests implications with
regards to the continued division of the reading unit. Tatum and
Jankowski (2013) note that some open access publishers provide formats
of articles that direct</p>
<blockquote>
reader attention to specific components of an article rather than an all
encompassing presentation or argument […. and] away from the traditional
linear structure of the scholarly journal article to an almost
postmodern conception of the article emphasizing visual, multiple modes
of presentation and online dynamic updating (p. 203).
</blockquote>
<p>What will be interesting to know and discuss is not only how such
presentation and emphasis impacts community identity, but also how our
interaction with the literature is constrained by a predominately query,
subject, aboutness, and relevance based framework rather than one that
is culturally based — information as increasingly atomized thing (datum)
instead of information as a cultural product with a historical
narrative.</p>

<p>Norman, Steve. (1988). "The Library Quarterly" in the 1930s: A
Journal of Discussion's Early Years." <em>The Library Quarterly,

<p><strong>Note:</strong> I'm taking a momentary break from my reading
of *LQ* to review an article on the same subject matter. Specifically,
this entry is about Steve Norman's historical article on the early years
of *The Library Quarterly*. Reference above.</p>
<h2 id="brief-literature-review">Brief Literature Review</h2>
<p>Wiegand's comment on this article:</p>
<blockquote>
Steve Norman analyzes the conflicts leading to the establishment of the
*Library Quarterly* at the University of Chicago's Graduate Library
School in 1931 and demonstrates the library community's resistance to
GLS's emphasis on research and scholarship. His work is an outstanding
piece of scholarship based on careful research into primary (and
unpublished) sources and shows the confusion early <em>LQ</em> editors
about determining publication criteria and the journal's early direction
and agenda (p. 563).
</blockquote>
<p>Wiegand, Wayne A. (1990). The literature of American library history.
<em>Libraries &amp; Culture, 25</em>(4), 543-574. url:<a
href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/25542291">http://www.jstor.org/stable/25542291</a></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Wiegand is right. From the start, this is a
fascinating piece. Norman begins by describing the state of affairs at
the time before the <em>LQ</em> began publication. Key highlights:</p>
<ul>
<li>Three Carnegie Corporation commissioned studies highlighted "a
growing dissatisfaction with training for librarianship" (p. 328). One
commission conducted by C. C. Williamson.</li>
<li>In response, "ALA formed in 1923 the Temporary Library Training
Board to set up a system for accrediting library schools" (p. 328). This
was made permanent in 1925.</li>
<li>A college degree, before this time, "was required for admission to
only two library schools. In fact, nearly half the instructors in
library schools were not college graduates" (p. 328).</li>
<li>Then this quote:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
The Graduate Library School at the University of Chicago (GLS) was to
encounter bitter hostility to this view that library education should
conform to a research university's model of graduate education. William
M. Randall, who was to become <em>LQ</em>'s first editor, wrote later
that "the attitude of (almost) the entire profession [was that they]
could see no possible need for the type of research organization that
Chicago was trying to establish" [1, p. 73]. <em>LQ</em> began
publication in this context.
</blockquote>
<p>The quoted source is:</p>
<p>Richardson, John, Jr. <em>The Spirit of Inquiry: The Graduate Library
School at Chicago, 1921-51</em>. Chicago: American Library Association.
1982.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> At one of the early GLS faculty meetings,
shortly after the idea of a "journal of discussion" was proposed, the
faculty decided to let "ALA to have an advisory board connected with a
GLS journal. If, however, the school financed the journal, the school
would have editorial control" (p. 330). It's interesting to think of
this as the beginnings of an early schism. Although that may be way too
powerful a term to describe this development.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Much of the early discussion about
establishing a journal centered on the journal functioning as an "organ"
of GLS. It would, that is, primarily be a medium of publication for the
output of research of GLS faculty and students. Although <em>LQ</em> did
not become an organ for GLS only publications, this early intent does
represent the small research culture that existed in librarianship at
the time.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> GLS faculty were very concerned about who
would have control of the journal. They wanted it to be under their
control and not ALA's.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Richard Bowker, then editor of the *Library
Journal*:</p>
<blockquote>
mentioned his hope that the new journal would not compete with other
publications [....] That Bowker had objected to possible competition is
likely considering his review of <em>LQ</em>'s first issue (p. 335).
</blockquote>
<p>Norman quotes a bit from that review, which was poor and reflects my
own thoughts, expressed in previous posts, on the lack of research
articles in the first issue of <em>LQ</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Norman's comment on <a
href="https://cseanburns.net/wiki/lq/volume-1-issue-1#article-1">C. C.
Williamson's</a> article in the first issue of *LQ* reflects what I had
thought about the intent of the journal (I seem to be on the right
track). Norman writes:</p>
<blockquote>
The decision by the GLS faculty to run Williamson's article as the first
in *LQ* implies that the journal was conceived, at least to some degree,
as a means of infusing scientific method into studies of library issues
(p. 336).
</blockquote>
<p>My first thoughts about this issue were that, it just takes time to
establish something like this---especially something like a serious
research journal---in a field that did not previously have a research
culture. Norman writes that the second issue was more positively
received, since it had more research articles, and that:</p>
<blockquote>
In any event, the six months between *LQ*'s establishment and its first
issue had not allowed much time for measuring up to five years' worth of
expectations (p. 337).
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Just before the conclusion section of the
article, Norman provides a descriptive breakdown or "distribution of
types of articles" (p. 348) published in the first five years of
<em>LQ</em>. This is helpful. Here's the breakdown:</p>
<ul>
<li>descriptive articles: 23%</li>
<li>library science research descriptive studies: 21%</li>
<li>opinion articles: 19%</li>
<li>historical articles: 13%</li>
<li>library science research experimental studies: 3%</li>
<li>sociological studies: 2%</li>
<li>textual criticism: 2% (p. 348)</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
Other nonresearch articles constituted the remainder (p. 348).
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Reflection:</strong> Norman's history of the first years of
<em>LQ</em> is more comprehensive in scope than my autoethnographic
reading of the first four issues of *LQ*. First, mine is not a history,
and as such, benefits from Norman's article greatly. Second, my focus is
only on the main articles published in these first four volumes, and
does not cover other types of articles, such as book reviews, and which
Norman does discuss. By way of that, the Sears/Thompson book review
controversy described by Norman from page 339 and on is quite
fascinating, in that it represents an early divide between the research
community and the practitioner community, by way of a misunderstanding
of their respective purposes and needs (and some hubris on the part of
certain portions of the research community, perhaps).</p>
<p><strong>Reflection:</strong> Aside from the interesting narrative
Norman provides in this article, the main implication, for me, is the
simple existence of such a narrative and what this means for those who,
perhaps too rashly, argue for moving beyond the journal simply because
web and Internet related technologies allow or afford moving beyond the
journal. That said, there may be merit in moving beyond the journal.
That will be for others to decide, and for various disciplines or fields
of research to determine for themselves. However, although such a move
may mean a loss or a gain for those research cultures, the role that
journals have played in developing a field or a professional identity
should be part of the discussion. In other words, history should be part
of the discussion.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> This is an information seeking note. My <a
href="https://cseanburns.net/wiki/lq/background#dokuwiki__top">abstract</a>
has an obvious omission: no literature review of any articles on the
<em>LQ</em>. At the time I wrote that abstract, I was more interested in
reviewing the literature on autoethnography. Also, the motivation, as
described in that abstract, led me toward a different set of literature
to review---literature on current scholarly communication problems and
issues. I <em>stumbled upon</em> Norman's history of the early years of
*LQ* because I pulled up the Wikipedia <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Library_Quarterly">article</a> on
the journal for a reason I can no longer remember. According to
Wikipedia's <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=The_Library_Quarterly&amp;direction=next&amp;oldid=411028346">revision
history</a> of its article on <em>LQ</em>, the reference to Norman's
article was added on February 10, 2011 by User *Wskent*.</p>
<p>After I found Norman's article, I did a keyword search for it, using
the names of the author and title, on <a
href="https://scholar.google.com/">Google Scholar</a> in order to
quickly see if any one had cited Norman's article. That's how I found
Wiegand's article (reference above), which briefly describes Norman's
piece. (I quote that description above.)</p>

<p>Williamson, C. C. (1931). The place of research in library science.
<em>The Library Quarterly, 1</em>(1), 1-17. url:<a
href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/40039624">http://www.jstor.org/stable/40039624</a></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The first article published in <em>The Library
Quarterly</em> is titled "The Place of Research in Library Service."</p>
<p>It was written by C. C. Williamson, who was affiliated with:</p>
<p><strong>Affiliation:</strong> School of Library Service, Columbia
University</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The author's name is listed at the end of the
article and not at the beginning.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The article is written in first person. This
may be due to the conventions at the time, but according to the first
footnote, the article is based on a speech that was delivered in 1930.
Use of the first person could be due to that.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> A number of literary references are made at
the beginning of the article.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The article itself is about showing the value,
or convincing young library students the value, of doing research.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> He begins with the questions, still asked
today, but often asked of him at the time:</p>
<blockquote>
"What is the future of library service?" "Will it offer me a
satisfactory career? (p. 2).
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> A point about the profession:</p>
<blockquote>
Development it seems to me has been too largely of a quantitative rather
than a qualitative character (p. 2).
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Another point about the profession, which is
relevant today, and about the increase in assistants (or perhaps,
<em>paraprofessionals</em>, although that term may be
anachronistic):</p>
<blockquote>
It is difficult to detect improvement in the professional status of the
librarian. The demand for so-called trained assistants has increased
notably in volume" (p. 3).
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> He lists a number of improvements in the next
few sentences, but he ends his list with this comment about the not so
great improvements for the librarian:</p>
<blockquote>
Salaries, and at the same time the prestige, of the more important
administrative positions have increased in a significant way, but for
the rank and file little progress seems to be made in remuneration and
in other evidences of satisfactory professional status (p. 3).
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> This is in agreement with what Arthur T.
Hamlin (1981) wrote about the professional status of academic
librarians. Specifically, it took 13 years after Williamson's essay for
academic librarians to gain faculty status. Hamlin wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
In 1944 the University of Illinois achieved full faculty status and rank
for all of its professional staff. It was the first major university to
take the step. Others followed with partial or complete recognition in
the 1950s and sixties. By the early seventies the majority of
universities has swung over to recognition of most, if not all, of the
professional staff as members of the faculty, often with faculty ranks
and titles (Hamlin, 1981, p. 120).
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Williamson believes that the professional
status of librarians, their prestige, is not being advanced because they
are not doing research. It doesn't seem to matter, to him, whether that
research is of a natural science kind, a social science kind, or a
humanistic kind, but simply that it is not being done.</p>
<p>Williamson's comment is, in a sense, in agreement with what Hamlin,
Shiflett, Carpenter, and Wiegand write. Specifically about the culture
of the primacy of knowledge creation over knowledge dissemination.

<p>Williamson goes on to cite a number of statistics and examples of how
and why research is important, and how quickly it is growing in other
fields. Then he notes its total absence in the library field:</p>
<blockquote>
What about research in the library field? A little sporadic work here
and there by individuals that may possibly be classified as research. No
organized or co-operative plans, or only the beginnings of such in two
or three university library schools. No money appropriated anywhere, so
far as I know, specifically for research in library service. Not a
single person employed anywhere by a library or a library system to
study problems of library service. No research fellowships. No research
professorships (p. 5).
</blockquote>
<p>Then this comment that pertains to <strong>The Library
Quarterly</strong>. Recall that this article is essentially a reprint or
a first printing of an earlier address, which is why it mentions the
future of this publication even though it's printed in this
publication:</p>
<blockquote>
One of the most hopeful indications that this condition may soon be
remedied is the fact that the Carnegie Corporation has recently
appropriated $25,000 to assist in starting a new library journal to be
edited and published at the Graduate Library School of the University of
Chicago (p. 5).
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> It's interesting to think that the term
<strong>library science</strong> precedes the actual science of library
related research:</p>
<blockquote>
Not infrequently I have been pessimistic enough about this situation
[that there is no research in the field] to wonder whether there is any
justification for using the term "library science." When the new library
school was started at Columbia four years ago we evaded the question by
calling it a "school of library service." That there is such a thing as
library service no one can doubt, and personally I do not doubt that it
ought to be based on a library science, but I wish the scientific
character of our professional activities and of our professional
literature were more obvious" (pp. 5-6).
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Williamson notes that to do library science
depends on how science is defined. First, he refers to Frederick Barry's
<strong>Scientific Habit of Thought</strong>. In essence, what is
important is a <strong>scientific attitude</strong> based on rational
investigation. Second, He refers to John Dewey and his work <strong>The
Sources of a Science of Education</strong>, which argues that science is
about the methods involved and not the subject matter.</p>
<p><strong>Reflection:</strong> Some of this discussion is based on the
(now obsolete) notion of William James' types of *men*: the tough-minded
(the scientific mind) and the tender-minded (the artistic mind). I'm not
disregarding Dewey's overall thoughts on scientific knowledge, empirical
knowledge, and so forth, just this classification as a truthful
psychological classification. Of course, although that classification
may be obsolete, it's relevant in the sense that many may often still
think of people that way, if only as an unquestioned world-view used to
judge and classify the various roles that exist. While I am enjoying
this article and think there's a lot of good points here, Williamson
adds that librarians may be composed of people of the tender-minded
sort. So his acceptance of William James' classification is problematic.
If we reject that premise, but pursue the same end game (that of a
library science as a research science), then what new premise do we
accept?</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Interesting discussion of empirical versus
scientific on pages 7 and 8.</p>
<blockquote>
library science is purely empirical. The average librarians is an
empiricist, not a scientist. Most administrative practices and technical
procedures are followed because they have been tried somewhere and have
been found to work. What psychological or other principles are involved
is unknown (p. 8).

<p>How has library science (or library and information science) schools
changed this? This has been examined. See, for example:</p>

&amp; R.D. Lankes (Eds.), <em>Creating the Reference Renaissance:

</ul>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> here Williamson quotes John Dewey in *How We
Think*:</p>
<blockquote>
Empirical inference follows the grooves and ruts that custom wears, and
has no track to follow when the groove disappears....."Skill enables a
man to deal with the same circumstances that he has met before,
scientific thought enables him to deal with different circumstances that
he has never met before.".... (pp. 8 - 9).
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Williamson makes an interesting turn on page
9. Let me quote a series of statements:</p>
<blockquote>
You may infer from what I have just been saying that librarians lack the
scientific attitude, are tender-minded rather than tough-minded, think
empirically rather than scientifically. No, that is not my conclusion
(p. 9).
</blockquote>
<p>Then:</p>
<blockquote>
Can it be that there are no problems in library service that call for
scientific research? .... No .... (p. 9).
</blockquote>
<p>Then:</p>
<blockquote>
A second possible reason that there is so little research in the field
of library service is that if it is a science at all and not an art, it
is only an applied science and that the necessary research is therefore
carried on in the underlying sciences---psychology, social science,
political science, etc. (pp. 9-10).
</blockquote>
<p>He dismisses that idea. And writes that:</p>
<blockquote>
To my mind the real reason that there is so little study of the problems
of library science is that practically no librarians have been trained
in scientific methods (p. 10).
</blockquote>
<p>He adds other issues that have prevented a *library science*.
Organizations are too small and a</p>
<blockquote>
deep-rooted prejudice among library workers against subjecting their
activities to scientific scrutiny (p. 10).
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> that first point, that the organizations may
be too small, suggests that automation was one, although I should add
not the only, causation of library science. This is in the sense that
library automation and computerization connected libraries together --
such that no library would henceforth exist as an island. Think, for
example, of Ralph Parker's piece:</p>
<ul>
<li>Parker, R. H. (June 1967). The small library faces the future.
<em>ALA Bulletin</em>, 669-671. url:<a
href="http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/4896241619">http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/4896241619</a></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> This sentiment has been mentioned before,
particularly, I believe, in Hamlin and Shiflett's work (mentioned
above):</p>
<blockquote>
We hear it said now and then by librarians of long experience and high
position that there is not sufficient content in the field of library
science to justify programs of study leading to the degree of Doctor of
Philosophy or even a Master's degree (p. 10).
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Important to his argument -- method is
primary:</p>
<blockquote>
Nothing short of a lifetime is sufficient to learn all that a librarian
needs to know! The important thing is training in scientific methods of
attacking and solving problems, the cultivation of the scientific spirit
and attitude. As soon as this is recognized and acted upon, library
science will become a reality. Until that time librarians, no matter how
many facts they carry in their heads, will be looked upon as clerks and
routinists (p. 11).
</blockquote>
<p>Here I think of Abbott:</p>
<ul>
<li>Abbott, A. (2004). Methods of discovery: Heuristics for the social
sciences. New York: W.W. Norton &amp; Company, Inc. url:<a
href="http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/827690286">http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/827690286</a></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> This counters those, especially among certain
higher education administrations in the 20th century (and librarians
too), thought of libraries as simply warehouses:</p>
<blockquote>
Those who see no field for research in library service or need of
advanced training for librarianship simply fail to recognize the
fundamental complexity of library science. To most librarians, as to
almost all others, it presents an entirely false appearance of
simplicity (p. 12).
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Williamson then makes a number of great points
about how other professions, i.e., psychology, sociology, statistics,
etc., cannot do the work of library science. Although library science
may draw from these fields, its issues are its own. Those other fields,
if they were to study libraries, would, Williamson argues, examine the
issues from their perspectives, thus contributing to the problem of <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D%C3%A9formation_professionnelle">Déformation
professionnelle</a>, or the "tendency to look at things from the point
of view of one's own profession," although he doesn't use that term.</p>
<p><strong>Reflection:</strong> I've been thinking a lot lately about
the problem of <em>déformation professionnelle</em> with respect to the
differences or approaches between <strong>library science</strong> and
<strong>information science</strong>. Specifically, if a purely
information scientist, that is, someone without a background or an
invested interest in library science, recommends something for
libraries, under what conceptual framework should that be considered and
how should that be evaluated? Here I'm thinking of a recent example:
when the <em>altmetrics</em> researchers suggest something in their
domain is beneficial to librarians and their work, does the point of
view of their recommendation include what library science has deemed to
be beneficial, or is the point of view solely an information science
one, where that view has been divorced from its sibling? Furthermore,
how do librarians accept or respond to such recommendations. See:</p>
<ul>
<li>Lapinski, S., Piwowar, H., &amp; Priem, J. (2013 June). Riding the
crest of the altmetrics wave. <em>College and Research Libraries News,
74</em>(6), 292-300. url:<a
href="http://crln.acrl.org/content/74/6/292.full">http://crln.acrl.org/content/74/6/292.full</a></li>
</ul>
<p>So, Williamson adds:</p>
<blockquote>
The psychologist cannot do the librarian's job; the sociologist cannot
do it (p. 13).
</blockquote>
<p>Has information science and library science diverged so much, in some
cases at least, where we might substitute psychologist or sociologist in
Williamson's statement with information scientist? The end point being
library science can incorporate information science theory and
knowledge, but it is not itself information science?</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Williamson then proceeds to discuss several
other really interesting issues, all of which, it seems to me, are still
quite relevant, discussed, and pursued today. I'll just mention these
things generally: the nature and problems with data collection, what
type of library science research could be undertaken, the education of
librarians where the end goal is not to make researchers but librarians
who can research, and the improvement to library teaching as a result of
a increased research.</p>
<p><strong>Reflection</strong>: This was a fascinating article and
surely a great introduction for *The Library Quarterly* in its inaugural
issue. I'm going to hold back, for now, on some autoethnographic
responses, but I'll get to it later, as I read more of this and later
issues. I especially want to get a sense of the character of this first
issue in order to see if there is something coherent about it as a
whole. This is important to one of the purposes of this research project
--- to understand the nature of the journal as a collective thing (a
one).</p>
<p><strong>Reflection</strong>: The discussion about whether *library
science* is a science is interesting, in the sense that it's similar to
a discussion that still sometimes happens today, about whether
<em>information science</em> is a science. Will we still be having this
discussion in another 80 years, in 2090?</p>

<p>This entry is about:</p>
<p>Putnam, Herbert. (1931). Consultants at the National Library. <em>The
Library Quarterly, 1</em>(1), 18-21. url:<a
href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/40039625">http://www.jstor.org/stable/40039625</a></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The second article published in <em>The
Library Quarterly</em> is titled "Consultants at the National Library."
It was written by Herbert Putnam, who was affiliated with:</p>
<p><strong>Affiliation:</strong> Library of Congress</p>
<p>At the time of this publication, he was head of the Library of
Congress, one of the last <strong>librarians</strong> to have this
role.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Putnam refers to the field as <em>library
economy</em>, indicating the original term for the field. As noted,
Williamson, in the first <em>LQ</em> article, uses the term <em>library
service</em>, and discusses <em>library science</em> as a field and
term. The use of so many terms signifies, I think, the number of great
changes happening in librarianship at the time.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> It is interesting that Putnam refers to
reference work as "the more popular" aspect of librarianship. That
seemed true up till six or seven years ago. I wonder, though, if it's
still true. My sense is that other forms of librarianship are growing in
popularity.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The first article in *LQ* is a reprint or
first print of a speech given by C. C. Williamson. This second article
is mostly an informative piece, with a bit of commentary and discussion,
about the use of expert consultants (faculty specializing in certain
fields of study) at the Library of Congress. Two articles into my
reading of the <em>LQ</em>, I'm aware that neither is a research
article. I mention this because the <em>Library Journal</em> had been
providing the function of informing and providing a discussion board to
the library community about such topics since 1876. In the first two
articles of this journal, the <em>LQ</em> has yet to become its own
thing -- still mimicking the function the <em>Library Journal</em> has
provided since its founding. I wonder how many articles I'll read before
I get a sense that the <em>Library Quarterly</em> has begun to truly
develop its own identity.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Although Putnam's article is short, it is a
loaded topic and touches upon the core of what it means to be a
librarian at a research library. At heart, the issue is about the
beneficial use of having subject specialists (i.e., faculty, professors,
researchers, etc. and not librarians), who are familiar not only with
the subjects of their fields but also the research methods used in those
fields, work at libraries to aid in collection development and provide
advanced library service to the public or the community at hand. The
article reflects the state of library education (and the librarian as a
professional) at the time, which was before C. C. Williamson's report
(<strong>The Williamson Report</strong> of 1923) and which recommended
graduate study, had the ability to truly have an effect on the state of
library education (see <a
href="http://www.ala.org/offices/hrdr/librarysupportstaff/history_of_library_support_staff">In
the Beginning ...</a>. Although it should be mentioned that the Graduate
Library School of the University of Chicago had already been founded by
this time, and it would have a major impact on the state of library
education as graduate study.</p>
<p>Putnam refers to the practice of librarianship as a "technique" (p.
19). It is interesting to compare this piece with the previous one
written by Williamson, who is arguing that librarianship can be much
more than a technique. Putnam, then, and at least based on this piece,
seems to have a growingly challenged (or obsolete?) view of
librarianship (for the time?). Odd to write that given his historical
influence.</p>
<p><strong>Reflection:</strong> From a historical perspective, the
subject matter of this article is interesting. However, my main interest
with this project is reflected in the note above about the becoming of
<em>LQ</em> as a research journal. When will this happen? The next
article? The next issue or volume? When will the <em>LQ</em> mature and
become the research journal it has been for most of its lifetime? What
kind of research will I encounter? Will it be social science (doubtful),
historical, ...? My guess is that <em>LQ</em>'s becoming will reflect
librarianship's (or library science's) own becoming. In fact, this is
largely my (so-called) hypothesis.</p>

<p>This entry is about:</p>
<p>Keppel, F. P. (1931). The Carnegie Corporation and the Graduate
Library School: A Historical Outline. <em>The Library Quarterly,
1</em>(1), 22-25. url:<a
href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/40039626">http://www.jstor.org/stable/40039626</a></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The third article published in <em>The Library
Quarterly</em> is titled "The Carnegie Corporation and the Graduate
Library School." It was written by F. P. Keppel, who was affiliated
with:</p>
<p><strong>Affiliation:</strong> Carnegie Corporation</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> It dawns on me that I do not know how many
library schools started with an endowment, whether by a corporation or
an organization such as the Carnegie Corporation.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Interesting quote about the intent to fund a
library school at Chicago:</p>
<blockquote>
The Corporation recognized that there was already in existence a number
of library schools of excellent professional standing, but in their
judgment there was no school which could be said to occupy for the
librarian's profession a position analogous to that of the Harvard Law
School or the John Hopkins Medical School (p. 23).
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The article is fairly straightforward and is
very much, as its title suggests, an outline. After the above quote,
Keppel lists a number of reasons for choosing the University of Chicago
as the place to create a new school (I'm not going to list these reasons
here, but I may want to come back to them later), he summarizes the
negotiations between the University and the Corporation about the
funding, and then he summarizes the University's process in establishing
the school.</p>
<p><strong>Reflection:</strong> As I commented in my previous post, such
an article could have easily gone into an issue of the <em>Library
Journal</em>, as it's primarily a note. However, when I remind myself
that this is the inaugural issue of the <em>LQ</em>, which is published
by the University of Chicago, then this short <em>outline</em> takes on
new meaning:</p>
<p>When I look at the table of contents of a scholarly journal that
launches in more recent times, the articles listed usually (it seems to
me) are research articles. The fact that the <em>LQ</em> does not (so
far) have any research articles suggests something about the broader
state of affairs at the time. Such that, the research culture (as
Williamson explains (see above)) just didn't exist for library science
at the time (we know that to be pretty much true---as we understand
research today, at least).</p>
<p>Given Williamson's article, this first issue by <em>this</em>
journal, this brief outline about the creation of the library school at
Chicago and the Carnegie Corporation's involvement, the launching of
this journal is very much itself an argument about the need for a
<strong>library science</strong>. Said otherwise, this journal's coming
into being is very much an act of <strong>creating</strong> a library
science. And it makes sense that the University of Chicago is the source
of the first research journal in library science, given the intent
behind the quote above (the creation of an <strong>esteemed</strong>
library school, the likes of which should resemble something akin to
Harvard Law). Perhaps then, the Carnegie Corporation should not only
"take the credit---or accept the responsibility" (p. 23) for all the
public libraries it built but for also, in some way, creating the
opportunity for a library science to exist. (That "credit" or
"responsibility" quote is in the article but I use it, tongue in cheek,
out of context.)</p>
<p><strong>Reflection:</strong> That I need to remind myself that this
is the inaugural issue, as I did above, is something that itself has
special import. While my goal with this project is to get a sense of the
journal as a thing in and of itself, a thing that has its own identity,
that is historically situated, and that has contributed substantially to
the identify of the field, I also have to try to read this journal
<em>fresh</em>---from the viewpoint of someone who is reading this
journal for the first time in 1931, when it was published. If I forget
to do that, then I will lose something in the experience or the reading,
or I will not notice things that may have been noticed or thought of by
readers at the time it was published.</p>

<p>This entry is about:</p>
<p>Waples, Douglas. (1931). The Graduate Library School at Chicago.
<em>The Library Quarterly, 1</em>(1), 26-36. url:<a
href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/40039627">http://www.jstor.org/stable/40039627</a></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The fourth article published in <em>The
Library Quarterly</em> is titled "The Graduate Library School at
Chicago." It was written by Douglas Waples, who was affiliated with:</p>
<p><strong>Affiliation:</strong> Graduate Library School, University of
Chicago</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The purpose of the article is to explain the
Graduate Library School (GLS) at Chicago. The motivation is based on the
relationship between GLS and the <em>LQ</em>. The author writes that
since the editing of the journal "will likely fall upon the staff" (p.
26) of the GLS, then an understanding of GLS and its policies should be
provided. The first footnote indicates that it was first delivered to
the Association of American Library Schools in 1929, which, I should
add, is presently known as the <a
href="http://www.alise.org/">Association of Library and Information
Science Education</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The article outlines nine policy statements
about the School. Notably, the School is meant to push research and not
to train future librarians.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Since GLS is primarily interested in producing
library science doctorates, the School represents, at the time, a new
model of library education. The question is, when did Schools begin to
merge this model with models related to library education, such that
they produce both doctorates headed for research and instruction and
Masters headed for librarianship?</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> As C. C. Williamson (see Issue 1, Article 1)
does, Waples refers, in a section titled "What is a Library Science?",
to John Dewey's <em>The Sources of a Science of Education</em>.</p>
<p>Of this piece, Waples write:</p>
<blockquote>
No writing has appeared to date which in short space so helpfully
presents a philosophy of research in the social studies (p. 30).
</blockquote>
<p>An interesting quote about this:</p>
<blockquote>
I take it no one has to argue any longer the fact that librarianship
*is* primarily a social enterprise; that only in so far as we know what
human needs are responsive to reading can we furnish the best reading in
the best way; that to this major problem the difficulties met in
administering library routine as at present organized are altogether
subordinate; and that what the librarian can ultimately contribute to
the advance of scholarship and hence to the welfare of society depends
entirely upon his ability to select from all fields of knowledge
whatever helps to reveal and satisfy the needs that reading can meet (p.
30).
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Related to "all fields of knowledge," Waples
writes that:</p>
<blockquote>
We are just beginning at Chicago to find out what elements of other
University departments and disciplines pertain to library problems. The
extent of such application is obviously great, far greater than we can
ever hope to evaluate precisely. But various other fields of study have
already been identified as capable of yielding laws, facts, and methods
of investigation from which a genuine science of librarianship may
evolve (pp. 33-34).
</blockquote>
<p>The fields include:</p>
<ul>
<li>bibliography</li>
<li>education</li>
<li>history</li>
<li>law</li>
<li>literary criticism</li>
<li>philosophy</li>
<li>political science</li>
<li>psychology</li>
<li>social service administration</li>
<li>sociology</li>
<li>statistics (p. 34).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The final section of the article functions as
an appendix (although not labeled as such) and outlines the topics that
were being investigated at GLS during its first two years (1928--1930).
In large part, and aside from the wording of the descriptions, many of
the topics under investigation read as if they could be present day
topics under investigation.</p>
<p><strong>Reflection:</strong> I don't have much to say about this
piece, within the context of my current project, but I have a hunch that
I will need to refer to it again later. At this point, the article's
presence in <em>LQ</em> signifies the general introductory nature of
this first issue. Given the message about research at GLS, I still find
it interesting that the first issue was not populated with research
articles, and I keep thinking that that is important. Since the list of
topics under investigation, at GLS, is about two pages long, it seems
that it could have been populated so. Perhaps, and as I commented in my
last post (Issue 1, Article 3), since *LQ* is the first research journal
for the field, the introductory nature of this issue is more important
than simply thrusting out research articles. That says to me something
about the historical importance of this journal (and others) and its
role in forming the identity of our field of study. Again, I refer to my
<a href="https://cseanburns.net/wiki/lq/background">abstract</a> for
what I mean by that.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> As I was reviewing my notes, and re-read the
line that follows, something occurred to me:</p>
<blockquote>
the librarian can ultimately contribute to the advance of scholarship
and hence to the welfare of society
</blockquote>
<p>If this piece had been written today, I'm fairly sure that the word
"libraries" would have been used instead of the word "librarian." So the
above line, and others like it, if written today, I imagine, would have
read like so:</p>
<blockquote>
*libraries* can ultimately contribute to the advance of scholarship and
hence to the welfare of society
</blockquote>

<p>So, I will incorporate this into our ethics research project. The
question to incorporate is: when did the field begin assigning agency,
responsibility, praise, action, and so forth to
<strong>libraries</strong> instead of to <strong>librarians</strong>. Of
course, one article does not make a trend, but I'm curious if there is
something to this. (How I'd incorporate that into an ethics research
project means changing the ethics research project a bit. Which is fine
because that project is a bit stalled and needs something.)</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> The fifth article published in <em>The Library
Quarterly</em> is titled "The Service Loads of Library-School
Faculties." It was written by Ernest J. Reese, who was writing on behalf
of the <em>Committee on Teaching Loads in Library Schools</em>, a
committee of the Association of American Library Schools (now ALISE),
and who was affiliated with:</p>
<p><strong>Affiliation:</strong> School of Library Service, Columbia
University</p>
<p>The article, according to the first footnote, is based on an earlier
report given to the Association.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> I'm not sure, yet, if I'll have much to say
about this piece. It's a report about the hours instructors spend on
various duties related to teaching and instruction as well as various
other non-course duties or activities. It's an interesting piece, for
historical reasons and, also, because in many ways it seems not much has
changed. I suppose it was an important piece at the time, given the
relative newness of library schools and a need to understand the
norms.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> One interesting, superficial bit is the way
distributions are conveyed in the time before computers. The
distributions are displayed in tables, with the mean of the numbers in
the top row, per the count of the numbers in the second row. It's a
fairly informative method of conveying the details. Both overall means
and medians are provided, which is nice. Medians are too often left out
of statistical reporting today.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> It seems, according to Table V in the article,
that most instructors spent about a half hour revising student work in
one of the courses. Good to know!</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The courses covered include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Library administration</li>
<li>Library routines</li>
<li>Reference books and work; bibliography</li>
<li>Book selection</li>
<li>Cataloguing</li>
<li>Classification</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The second section covers data on non-course
activities. As listed on pages 46-47 include:</p>
<ul>
<li>care for student welfare</li>
<li>oversight of field work</li>
<li>editing of school publications</li>
<li>preparation of exhibits</li>
<li>attendance at school social functions</li>
<li>official participation in general activities of institutions which
which schools are connected, e.g., universities and library commissions
(pp. 46-47).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Per Table XIV on page 47, the "time per week
spent in non-course activities": *n* = 47, *m* = 10.24, and *mdn* = 9.37
(p. 47).</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Interesting quote about how the data can be
used to assess instructors' working loads. Key words or ideas that stick
out to me include: health, work environment (physical conditions),
scholarly and professional demands, wise decisions.</p>
<blockquote>
Also, the health of individuals, the physical conditions under which
they must work, the demands pressing upon them because of their
professional records, all may influence vitally the effort to reach wise
decisions in particular cases. A teacher's service program is obviously
not a think to which time-clock methods can be applied (p. 48).
</blockquote>
<p>And this quote, as far as applying the data to specific
individuals:</p>
<blockquote>
The case may be taken of an instructor believed to occupy a middle
rather than an extreme position as to speed and experience, who is in
good though not robust health, who works steadily but without tension or
excess, who has taught a variety of subjects, and to suit whose
abilities some reallocation of existing assignments can be considered
(p. 48).
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The next part is very interesting, as the
author suggests the number of hours, based on the medians reported in
the earlier part of the paper and other numbers including class size,
that could be devoted to each course per week (esp. for new instructors
who haven't built up experience or materials to draw from). They
include, for one section courses (although numbers are often given for
courses taught in two sections):</p>
<ul>
<li>Library administration: 9.18 hours per week</li>
<li>Library routines: 5.38 hours per week</li>
<li>Reference books and work: 13 hours per week</li>
<li>Classification: 23.25 hours per week</li>
<li>Non-course activities: 9.37 hours per week (pp. 49-50).</li>
</ul>
<p>There are a number of caveats and exceptions in the above numbers.
Reece, for example, offers numbers based on deductions for time spent by
assistants and for other reasons.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The article ends with two appendices, though
they are not labeled as such. The first is a copy of the letter sent to
faculty requesting their participation in the study. The second is the
handout given to faculty and that was used to collect the data.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> While I wrote above that not much has
changed---one key difference between then and now is that this article
reflects a point in time when instructors in library schools were not
overwhelmingly PhDs, and so this report does not take into consideration
the amount of time needed to do research.</p>
<p><strong>Reflection:</strong> Although it's a report and not a
scientific study, this is the first data driven article in the *LQ*. I
am not, as of yet, being very autoethnographic in my field notes, and
I'll have to say something about that in a future post. I'm taking this
time as a period of figuring things out.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> The sixth article published in <em>The Library
Quarterly</em> is titled "The Relation of the College Library to Recent
Movements in Higher Education." It was co-authored by Floyd W. Reeves
and John Dale Russell, who were affiliated with:</p>
<p><strong>Affiliation:</strong> University of Chicago</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Another source confirming <a
href="http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/7836638">Shiflett</a> and <a
href="http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/7276988">Hamlin</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
It is only in comparatively recent decades that the maintenance of a
library has been recognized as a necessary function of a college (p.
57).
</blockquote>
<p>The rest of the paragraph provides a nice description.</p>
<p>And it was a problem even up to the time of writing, or near to
it:</p>
<blockquote>
Although the stronger and better-administered colleges began early to
develop systematic plans for increasing the effectiveness of their
libraries, the condition which has been described persisted in most of
the weaker institutions until well into the twentieth century (p. 57).
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The next paragraph details some of the reasons
why colleges began building up their libraries: standardizing
associations and state departments of education, namely.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The next paragraph details why they didn't
build up their libraries before. Namely:</p>
<blockquote>
The principal reason for this lack of interest in the library is
probably attributable to the "lesson-hearing" and textbook type of
instruction which as prevailed in colleges. Under such instructional
methods little use is made of the library. The instructor merely assigns
"so many pages in the text for next time," and when the class meets
again the hour is devoted to hearing a recitation on the assigned
materials in the text" (p. 58).
</blockquote>
<p>Regarding the above quote, frame this problem today with respect to
undergraduates' use of the library (and their use of textbooks),
graduates' use of the library (and their use of textbooks). The
correlation is probably strong and negative, even today.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> As with the above quote, not much sometimes
changes:</p>
<blockquote>
In fact, under the "textbook" plan of instruction, a library assignment
is looked upon by students as something of a bore, as just another chore
to be performed for an overconscientious instructor (p. 59).
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The authors suggest that changes in higher
education trends will impact library development in certain ways.
First:</p>
<blockquote>
The first educational movement which affects the library is the rapid
increase which has occurred in the amount of course work carried in the
field of the social sciences (p. 59).
</blockquote>
<p>The authors go on to say that a decline or a leveling of courses in
foreign languages and mathematics, both of which tend to not need the
use of the library, and an increase in social studies courses, which
require more library reading, as well as student bodies, will involve
more use of the library.</p>
<p>Also, social studies / social sciences are fields where,</p>
<blockquote>
new material is being produced at a comparatively rapid rate (p. 60).
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: Second:</p>
<blockquote>
A second educational movement affecting library conditions in the
college is the introduction of general survey courses (p. 60).
</blockquote>
<p>Although since survey courses are now well established, this is
probably not true today:</p>
<blockquote>
It is the observation of the writers that these survey courses do not
function satisfactorily where given by the textbook method (p. 61).
</blockquote>
<p>Although, I mean "probably not true today" in certain way. It may be
true that textbooks do not do well for survey courses, but anthologies,
functioning in the same way as textbooks, might. And the use of
anthologies might deter library use now. So, I'm just generalizing from
textbooks to anything that students have to buy that diminishes their
need to use the library.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Third:</p>
<blockquote>
A third educational movement which will have an effect upon the library
is the change in the methods of science teaching (p. 61).
</blockquote>
<p>Basically the authors argue that science teaching is becoming less
dependent on laboratory work, at least in the early years of higher
education, and more dependent on lectures and outside reading.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Fourth:</p>
<blockquote>
Within the last few years a large number of the better colleges of the
country have introduced independent work courses, sometimes referred to
as "honors" work (p. 62).
</blockquote>
<p>Of note about this: this trend would not only require more library
material but it would also require, the authors note, a need for
reference librarians who can help the independent students find relevant
work related to their independent studies.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Fifth:</p>
<blockquote>
Some colleges and universities are experimenting with the introduction
of a course of general reading. Such a course cuts straight across
departmental lines, in an attempt to give students a broad and general
view of the classic expressions of human thought in all fields (p. 62).
</blockquote>
<p>The authors note, that in response to this trend, not only is more
material needed in the library, but the library has responded by setting
up reading or seminar rooms. This was another important point in
[Shiflett][1] and [Hamlin][2].</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: Sixth:</p>
<blockquote>
Another educational movement affecting the library is the breaking-down
of the hard-and-fast barriers which have separated the various fields of
study into departments, and the provision for a much greater degree of
correlation of subject matter in related fields (p. 63).
</blockquote>
<p>This trend died a long time ago. Instead of majors and minors, some
colleges were using fields of concentration, usually four to eight of
them. Nice idea.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: Seventh:</p>
<blockquote>
Another educational movement which will affect the college library is
the development of graduate study (p. 63).
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: The authors then list the kinds of demands
these seven movements will have on the college library.</p>
<ul>
<li>larger book collection (p. 64)</li>
<li>"care in the selection of library materials" (p. 65)</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
An attempt to extend the book collection rapidly usually overtaxes the
ability of faculty members to select books (p. 65).
</blockquote>
<p>Also in agreement with Shiflett, Hamlin, and others. Academic
librarians didn't begin collection development, in the whole, until the
1940s.</p>
<p>Back to our list:</p>
<ul>
<li>"larger facilities for study by students" (p. 65)</li>
<li>"better trained library staff" (p. 65), including for selection of
books and for the need of good reference librarians</li>
<li>"direct instruction in the techniques of bibliography" (p. 65). What
we today call *information literacy instruction*. There's been the
occasional problem, I've noticed, that information literacy efforts are
new when they're actually, as this article proves, over eight decades
old.</li>
<li>self-evalation or "continuous self-survey" (p. 66) (that is, of the
library)</li>
</ul>
<p>An important final quote, and perhaps one of the original uses of the
<em>library as center of the academy</em> theme:</p>
<blockquote>
The college library of the future, if it is to serve adequately the
needs of the institution, must become the center of academic activities
(p. 66).
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Reflection</strong>: This is an important historical piece.
I'll come back to it.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> The seventh article published in <em>The
Library Quarterly</em> is titled "Three Hundred Days in Roman
Libraries." It was authored by Geneva Drinkwater, who was affiliated
with:</p>
<p><strong>Affiliation:</strong> University of Chicago</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> This is a very delightful account about, as
the title suggests, a trip to Roman libraries. It begins with a trip to
the "Santa Scolastica in Subiaco," a monastery where St. Benedict lived,
and ends at the Vatican library. Although very brief, the piece is a
wonderful description of Geneva Drinkwater's experience oversees. There
are few descriptions of the libraries, but that's not the focus.</p>
<p>Perhaps because I was intrigued by the name, I did a quick web search
for Geneva Drinkwater and have discovered that this is the kind of
person who makes good history (read her bio below). Actually, it's a
nice reminder that behind every paper I read, there's a person. That may
seem obvious, but it's easy to read papers without thinking about the
author. That's, actually, part of the point with scientific authorship.
I'd have to look it up, but I think that point was made by either Robert
K. Merton or Derek J. de Solla Price.</p>
<p>Here are a couple of brief biographies and the second link contains a
link to an oral history that she is reading:</p>

<p>I was quite happy to discover that Drinkwater and I both went to
school at the same place (University of Missouri) and worked at the same
place (Stephens College).</p>

affiliated with:</p>
<p><strong>Affiliation:</strong> Swarthmore College</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The article begins by noting that the Carnegie
Corporation (CC) has taken an interest in academic libraries. Because of
this, librarians are seeking grants from (CC). This may be the first
instance (at a non-trivial scale, at least) of academic libraries
seeking outside funding in the form of grants.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> This article is turning out to be a humorous
account involving the agreements and disagreements among faculty about
the best works (or the works that a college library should hold) for a
college library. It would make a good collection management class
reading. And the process of dividing up the books by three zones is
interestingly similar to Bradford's Law, which was published about three
after this article.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> This is a nice read. Here's a point by the
author that reflects the sentiment of the piece:</p>
<blockquote>
There is no consistent relationship between the number of books per
capita and the circulation per book.... Two possibilites, therefore,
present themselves. Either some nationalities read more than others, or
the books in certain libraries are better chosen than those in others.
The latter seems more probable (p. 87).
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> This article makes me want to time travel back
to 1931 and get a faculty job at the Graduate Library School. Lots of
humor in the writing.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> In seriousness, this is a really wonderful
article. I would have expected it to be less enlightened about foreign
language material, but it's probably much more enlightened than many
present day policies are. It ends with some good questions---both about
the purpose of the public library and about how to carry out additional
research. It's another possible reading item for a collection management
class (at least suggested reading item).</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> The first article of the second issue of
<em>The Library Quarterly</em> is titled "The Public Library under the
City-Manager Form of Government" It was written by Carleton B. Joeckel,
who was affiliated with:</p>
<p><strong>Affiliation:</strong> University of Michigan</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The second part of this article was published
in Vol. 1, Issue 3 and my post on it is here:</p>
<p>[Joeckel1931b](/blog/2013/09/27/lq-vol-1-issue-3-article-6-reading-study/)</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> A powerful introduction set within the context
of why libraries do not receive much attention, much financial support
from their municipal governments, and little pay for their
librarians:</p>
<blockquote>
Moreover, notwithstanding the best publicity efforts of modern
librarians, the library has never been a spectacular feature of
government. The basis of its success consists of thousands of individual
units of service to its many users. It cannot point with pride to single
outstanding achievements, such as the construction of a new street or a
new bridge, the capture of a notorious criminal, or the extinguishing of
a dangerous fire (pp. 121--122).
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Two lines of public library development:</p>
<ul>
<li>public libraries attached to school districts</li>
<li>public libraries attached to city governments</li>
</ul>
<p>Then the notion of the board of library trustees is introduced. Such
that:</p>
<blockquote>
So firmly has the board idea intrenched [sic] itself in library
administration that librarians themselves have come to regard it almost
as a sacred and inalienable right, variation from which is unthinkable
and not to be tolerated. Scant space is given in writings by librarians
to other forms of library government; and the librarian has come, pretty
generally, to accept the *sui generis* idea of the library's place in
municipal affairs. The librarian still feels that the library's place
*is* different and distinct from all other parts of the municipal
government and, as such, is entitled to special and separate
consideration at all times. He often fails to realize that the board
plan was but one phase of the development of municipal administration
and that library organization took shape as it did largely because of
the existing fashion prevalent at the moment in municipal government
rather than from any special design (pp. 123--124).
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>public libraries in the "council-manager government" (p. 125)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> This is likely the first research article to
appear in this journal, as we would understand that concept / construct
today. That said, it differs from the form presented today, even though
only superficially. That is, there are no literal Introduction,
Literature Review, Findings, Discussion, etc. sections marked off, but
the article naturally follows that kind of organization, even though its
sectioned off differently. Personally, I like it.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Joeckel finds five types of public library
management with each type containing finer grain categories (quoted in
bits):</p>
<blockquote>
1. School library districts
2. Municipal public libraries with independent library boards
3. "Corporation" libraries with self-perpetuating boards
4. Libraries managed by non-governmental associations
5. Municipal public libraries under the control of city manager (pp.
128--129).
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> After laying out his classification of the
legal organization of these public libraries, Joeckel proceeds to
describe each type and provide examples from the various cities he
examined.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The final two appendices are extremely
helpful. The first appendix lays out his findings in tabular form. The
second in charts and diagrams.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The article ends with a note that a second
part will be issued in July.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> This article would benefit a variety of
courses in a LIS program:</p>
<ul>
<li>management of libraries</li>
<li>history of libraries</li>
<li>ethical issues in libraries (as the control of various parts of the
library will have an effect on what librarians can do at any specific
library. For example, whether they can purchase books).</li>
</ul>
<p>I've heard a few people raise the idea that there should be more
integration between LIS programs (especially lines in the LIS programs
that focus on public libraries) and political science programs. This
article is evidence that such a relationship would be fruitful.</p>

href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/40038535">http://www.jstor.org/stable/40038535</a></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The second article of the second issue of
<strong>The Library Quarterly</strong> is titled "Children and the
Public Library." It was written by Alfred S. Lewerenz, who was
affiliated with:</p>
<p><strong>Affiliation:</strong> Los Angeles City Schools</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> This article takes a look at children's use of
public libraries in Los Angeles. One of the first observations: the
study is not based on a random selection of students, although the
selection of students does attempt to be methodological and
*scientific*. As a result, methodological bias is indicated or could be
suspected.</p>
<p>Second, while many of the previous articles I have read in this
study, with minor editing, read like they could have been written more
recently, this article strikes me as something you would actually find
in the 1930s -- esp. because of its focus on IQ.</p>
<p>That being said, it is interesting to read such an early study that
looks at whether there is anything distinctive about the kinds of people
who would visit the library. That is, the fundamental questions here
are: who are the people who visit the library, are they different from
the general population, and if so, how?</p>
<p>That also being said, there is some confusion in the article, at
least in my of reading it. That is, this is a study of children who are
sent to public libraries by their schools. Yet the article suggests that
there is something different about these children <strong>a
priori</strong> instead of as a result of the schools sending them to
the public library. I am not clear on what the author is saying
here.</p>
<p>Note: There are a whole host of issues with the following statement,
and it is almost comical in a bad sci-fi movie kind of way. But perhaps
there is something positive in the idea that they were aware in the
1930s that the location of the public library was important; or, perhaps
the idea that the placement of the public library in a city is important
comes from ideas about the distribution of populations of "subnormal
mentality" in a city:</p>
<blockquote>
the public library may not have branches which serve sections of the
city inhabited by a population of subnormal mentality (p. 157).

written by A. H. Starke, who was affiliated with:</p>
<p><strong>Affiliation:</strong> Chicago, IL (No affiliation)</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> This is another article on children and public
libraries. It's written in response to an early committee / study
designed to answer questions about children and reading.</p>
<p>Here's an interesting set of questions about the lack of information
about the topic:</p>
<blockquote>
One asks in vain what part of the 47 percent of our people without
public library service are children; how many of the two and a quarter
million books circulated annually from our public libraries are juvenile
books or books withdrawn for juvenile reading; how many of the 15,000
and more trained or experienced librarians in the United States are
trained for, or are doing work with, children; what amount of the
thirty-five and a third million dollars spend on public library work
each year is spent on children's books, or the maintenance of children's
rooms, or for salary of children's librarians (p. 177)?
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> This article is turning out to be a really
excellent rant against the lack of information (and lack of books) about
what children get at libraries and elsewhere.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> This rant is so good, I'm beginning to find it
humorous:</p>
<blockquote>
On the other hand, it seemed a little ridiculous that any scientific
study, involving the expenditure of much time and often large sums of
money, should present only the conclusion that "students of the school
studied and read a great variety of magazines" or that "fiction seems to
have a greater grip on the reading interests of boys and girls than
reading matter of an informational sort"--conclusions any worker with
children knows almost a priori to be true (p. 182).
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Even on topics of diversity, this author is
remarkably awesome and scathing of his contemporaries:</p>
<blockquote>
But after considerable investigation only four studies of the reading
interests and ability of negro children were discovered, and none of the
reading habits and interests of children of other races; nor, in the
many studies of children's reading, had the factor of face received much
attention in the statements made concerning the home environment and the
social background of the children studied. The aim of most investigators
had been, apparently, to study "an even stratum of American middle-class
life," "100 percent American" (and presumably Nordic) boys and girls, as

now:</p>
<blockquote>
As on many topics, of course, librarians could give no help at all (p.
185).

<p><strong>Note:</strong> The fourth article of the second issue of
<em>The Library Quarterly</em> is titled "What Subjects Appeal to the
General Reader?." It was written by Douglas Waples, who was affiliated
with:</p>
<p><strong>Affiliation:</strong> Graduate Library School, University of
Chicago</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Waples begins with a nice starting question,
one that he acknowledges would be nice to answer yet difficult to do
so:</p>
<blockquote>
why is it that some people read and others do not (P. 189).
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> It will be important to highlight how the
topics in many of these early *LQ* articles are still the topics we are
working on today. I'll need to classify these in my paper on this.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> This is really a fantastic article on reading,
or, on "what people would like to read about" (p. 191).</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> I think one key insight about this paper,
regardless (or because) of the findings it reports, is that
understanding reading will require understanding both books and people.
Neither can be investigated separately if any hope of understanding what
it means to read is desired.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Damaging:</p>
<blockquote>
Another example will serve to show how the procedure may be used to find
the subjects of most interest to a given community. A public librarian,
of long experience in small and medium-sized communities, selected 23 of
the 117 topics appearing on the check-list when asked to select topics
on which most books needed to be purchased to meet the public library
demand. Sixteen groups were then chosen as best representing a typical
American community. The 23 topics considered by the librarian to be most
in demand were then compared with the topics in which most interest was
expressed by the sixteen groups. Only 3 topics appeared in both lists!
Twenty of the 23 library topics were relatively uninteresting to half of
the sixteen groups and 12 other topics, not selected by the librarian,
were found to be just as interesting as the 3 most interesting topics he
had selected (p. 198).
</blockquote>
<p>Read more of Waples' work on reading.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Historically, an interesting tidbit:</p>
<blockquote>
About thirty public libraries and many college libraries make some
provision for helping readers to find books of most interest and value.
In public libraries such help is given by an assistant called "reader's
adviser" (pp. 200-201).

<p><strong>Note:</strong> The fifth and last article of the second issue
of <em>The Library Quarterly</em> is titled "The Dentition of 'Equus
Donatus.'" It was written by Pierce Butler, who was affiliated with:</p>
<p><strong>Affiliation:</strong> The Newberry Library</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> This is an interesting essay by one of the
founders of the term *library science,* specifically in his role as a
librarian at The Newberry Library, one of the great American research
libraries.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The essay begins by noting the importance
gifts have been to libraries in America's history. Then it proceeds to
make a case that an understanding of philanthropy and libraries is
necessary for a theory of librarianship to develop (probably still true
today).</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Butler then offers a critique that focuses on
the purpose of collecting rare books when compared to the social mission
of the library and the library's commitment to its community. This seems
to be the real value of the essay, although the specifics are important
for other reasons too. It's a nice use of a heuristic: the library has a
mission, and if something violates that mission, even if that something
seems to align with it, then what violates must be examined and possibly
set aside, no matter how seemingly worthy it is.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Regarding the previous note about the
relationship between libraries and philanthropy, and the impact this has
on a theory of librarianship, I add this note from Irene S.
Farkas-Conn's work <a

<blockquote>
After World War II, the government took over the role played earlier by

Warner Bishop</a>, who was affiliated with:</p>
<p><strong>Affiliation:</strong> University of Michigan Library</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Interesting note about undergraduate work,
from a historical perspective:</p>
<blockquote>
The age of the textbook has not passed; witness the steady stream
issuing from the presses of the country. But the age of a single
textbook to a course has gone. Books to be used in even undergraduate
instruction are legion, and materials for research are being published
in a volume unsensed by anyone who fails to keep close watch on the
yearly output of the world's printing presses (p. 246).
</blockquote>
<p>After this study is completed, I'll have to read issues of LQ after
WWII, just to see how the sentiment and the orientation has changed.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> On the university:</p>
<blockquote>
This past century has seen also the rise of the academy from its early
eighteenth-century state of amiable curiosity to the position of a
powerful agency for promoting research and publishing its results (p.
247).
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Another, on scholarly publishing, written in
1931:</p>
<blockquote>
The Surgeon-General's Library in Washington now receives 1,887 medical
journals from all over the world. Journals and yet more journals! No
branch of science is so limited, no industry so small, no specialty so
narrow as to have *no* periodical devoted to its progress. The past
fifty years have seen the rise of the specialized periodical. Most
university professors would part with all the monographs on their
subjects rather than give up their files of journals. It is a day of
serial publication, and serials are both bulky and costly--yet we must
have them (pp. 247-248).
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Remarkable passage on page 249 that questions
whether, given all this publishing output, libraries are justified,
given their costs.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> On what is essentially a proposal for off-site
facilities for book storage and whether it would be a good idea to have
them:</p>
<blockquote>
Perhaps, if communication is speeded tenfold so that readers or books
may be hurled through the air from New Haven to Washington or New York
in a few minutes, or if by television or some further wonder a book in a
central storehouse may be shown instantly page by page in a receiving
room in a library thousands of miles away, we shall come to the central
storage idea (p. 250).
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Is this still true? If so, then how. If not,
then what's next?</p>
<blockquote>
Starving the library hurts--not the librarian--but the scholar (p. 251)?
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Nice few passages about librarian education
and librarianship beginning on page 252.</p>
<p>In fact, library automation helped solve this problem--liberate
librarians from that drudgery:</p>
<blockquote>
The pressure of work, of size, of numbers, in our university libraries
has kept their employees so burdened with routine duties that in general
those who have the ability have had no time or strength for productive
work or for advancing knowledge (p. 253).

</blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> This is simply a fascinating story. It's also
a reminder that early printing was fueled by religious and political
motivations. Information as power, as commodity, etc.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> I'm not really targeting the point of this
article with these notes -- just finding a number of interesting
tidbits:</p>
<blockquote>
and a much later historian of the books and libraries of Russia,
Bakhtiarov, mentions, in connection with his description of the
book-losses sustained by the Russians in the course of the French
invasion of 1812, that leather-bound books from Bause's collection were
used by the French soldiers to cover the muddy street in front of the
house so that carriages could enter the yard (p. 265).

<p><strong>Note:</strong> The third article of the third issue of
<em>The Library Quarterly</em> is titled "The Sociological Beginnings of
the Library Movement."</p>
<p>It was written by Arnold K. Borden, who was affiliated with:</p>
<p><strong>Affiliation:</strong> Dartmouth College</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> This is the kind of article I'm really
interested in reading. First off, though, is a citation to a book that I
have read about and have seen references to in past studies and in this
one. It happens to be available from <a
href="http://archive.org">archive.org</a>. It is:</p>
<p>William S. Learned. (1924). <a
href="http://archive.org/details/americanpublicli007473mbp">The American
Public Library and the Diffusion of Knowledge</a>. New York: Harcourt,
Brace and Company.</p>
<p>Borden has this to say about the Learned book:</p>
<blockquote>
From a strictly contemporary point of view the sociological study by W.
S. Learned is illuminating but does not aim to be retrospective (p.
278).
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Borden begins by noting the failure, up to
that time, of librarians or others in studying the beginnings of public
libraries. He writes:</p>
<blockquote>
Although next to the public-school system and the press the library
exercises the greatest educative influence in the state, it rarely
appears to be given much weight in the deliberation of sociologists and
political scientists (p. 278).
</blockquote>
<p>I believe <a href="http://home.uchicago.edu/aabbott/">Andrew
Abbott</a> has made that same criticism in regards to his own field's
lack of attention on libraries.</p>
<p>Also, I believe the development of <em>library science</em> was
partially a response to the lack of inquiry that existed in this area.
Under this view, <em>library science</em> is interpreted as a kind of
political science or sociology of libraries.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> This is true and a very important point:</p>
<blockquote>
In 1850 there were about 100 libraries of 5,000 or more volumes or more
aggregating something like 1,000,000 volumes. In 1890 there were 4,000
libraries containing 27,000,000 volumes. In this period the first
library convention was held (1853), and the American Library
Association, the State School at Albany, and the <em>Library
Journal</em> were founded. Surely the causes for this phenomenal growth
must lie sufficiently deep to call for more than superficial
investigation (pp. 278-279).
</blockquote>
<p>I wonder if library science, as a field, can support a sort of
library history as well as a <a
href="http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/525290504">cliometric-style library
history</a> in the form of specific departments dedicated to this area
of inquiry.</p>
<p>Regarding the 1853 conference, this is an important book (I read
about a year ago):</p>
<p>Utley, George Burwell. <em>The librarians' conference of 1853, a
chapter in American library history.</em> Chicago: American Library
Association, 1951. url:<a
href="http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/1370309">http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/1370309</a></p>
<p>The cliometric link above refers to (I've read parts of this):</p>
<p>McMullen, Haynes. (2000). <em>American Libraries before 1876</em>.
Westport, Conn: Greenwood Press, 2000.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> An explanation has been sought. While I have
an understanding of what has been researched in this area, I'll just
note that this is one of the most highly cited articles in my study so
far.</p>
<blockquote>
But when one has reviewed all the accomplishments of government and
individuals, the reasons behind the rapid library expansion in the
latter half of the nineteenth century remain unexplained (p . 280).
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Reflection:</strong> When I begin analyzing my data for this
study (using these field note entries), I should make note of which
articles I've commented on the most and classify those articles by
whatever type emerges. I think this will say something about what I am
trying to discover in this study. (Wow, a lot of reflexivity!)</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Important note about the relationship between
public schools and public libraries, and the view of public libraries as
an extension of public schools:</p>
<blockquote>
In the first place the library movement was intimately associated with
the establishment of free public schools. Logically, it would seem that
the public school was a necessary prelude to the library, that a body of
people capable of reading must be created before the library could
perform a significant function in the community (p. 280).
</blockquote>
<p>Imagine closely reading these <em>LQ</em> issues at the times they
were published and received by the readers. This article, followed by
the article on *The Public Library under the City-Manager Form of
Government*, pair well. That is, together they lead to a broader
understanding of, for example, why some early public libraries were
attached to school districts rather than to city governments. I
commented on that article <a
href="https://cseanburns.net/wiki/lq/volume-1-issue-2#article-1">here</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Here the library is seen not necessary as a
mechanism to advance democracy by the government but as a mechanism to
advance democracy by an already democratic people. The view, seems to
be, that creating public libraries can be understood as a type of
survival and growth mechanism. (I'm aware that my use of the term
<strong>mechanism</strong> may not be the most appropriate.):</p>
<blockquote>
Another antecedent condition favoring the growth of public libraries was
the increased voting strength of the people (p. 281).
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Leisure and libraries. Here we have the
problem that there are now many ways to go about leisure. Thus the
public library, today, is in competition with other leisurely providing
entities:</p>
<blockquote>
Attendant upon the increase of wealth resulting from the establishment
of the factory system and the exploitation of the natural resources of
the country was the increase of leisure demanded by labor (p. 281).
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> This is a great line:</p>
<blockquote>
Students of library history, therefore, must not look upon the library
as an isolated phenomenon or as something which has been struck off the
brains of individuals in moments of philanthropic zeal (p. 282).
</blockquote>
<p>He ends the article with:</p>
<blockquote>
From the point of view of history as well as from that of contemporary
conditions the library needs to be studied in the light of sociology,
economics, and other branches of human knowledge (p. 282).
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Reflection:</strong> I really enjoyed this article. It
provides questions that still need answers today.</p>
<p><strong>Reflection:</strong> Competition is still key, I think, for
understanding libraries today:</p>
<ul>
<li>public libraries vs. other leisurely activities</li>
<li>academic libraries vs. information seeking behaviours + information
use (my dissertation)</li>

href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/40039659">http://www.jstor.org/stable/40039659</a></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The fourth article of the third issue of
<em>The Library Quarterly</em> is titled "The Library School
Curriculum."</p>
<p>It was written by Harriet E. Howe, who was affiliated with:</p>
<p><strong>Affiliation:</strong> Graduate Library School, University of
Chicago</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Wow, this is a great opening line:</p>
<blockquote>
In discussing education for librarianship, the assumption is made that
librarianship is a profession (p. 283).
</blockquote>
<p>And the following passage explains why library school is not (and
should not be) a technical school:</p>
<blockquote>
There are data now available that serve to distinguish clerical duties
from professional duties in the cataloging department. By means of such
data it becomes possible to omit from the library-school course all
purely clerical operations as such. However, it is still desirable to
retain such emphasis on clerical duties as will enable the professional
cataloguer to supervise the clerical work intelligently (p. 283).
</blockquote>
<p>The question is, then, how much of a separation of clerical duties
from professional duties has there been since this was published in
1931, over 80 years ago? Out of interest of defining the profession as a
profession, this would be nice to map.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> On the need to be adaptable:</p>
<blockquote>
A second principle governing the curriculum requires that the best
current practice be taught with sufficient allowance for future
improvements and expansions (p. 283).
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> This is great:</p>
<blockquote>
Librarianship is rapidly shifting its attention from the mechanics of
administration to the needs of the reader (p. 284).
</blockquote>
<p>And I think this explains quite a bit about library reference
courses, as they are taught today:</p>
<blockquote>
In all the library schools there are courses called "reference," or
"reference and bibliography." Usually these courses are devoted to the
study of reference books--not, as one teacher wishes that they might be,
to reference work. "We use no reference book as a final source for
information for the reader. We use any source, whether it is a
circulation or a reference book, a library catalogue, correspondence, or
the picture file. Another teacher has advocated the teaching of the
courses now called "book selection" and "reference" as one course,
discussing books by subject from the standpoint of their potential
readers" (pp. 284-285).
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Reflection:</strong> The next couple paragraphs address
questions and issues related to courses teaching in a way that will
allow students to generalize to their specific interests. This is an
important development in the thinking about librarianship, and based on
my readings so far, it is easy to see the effect that this type of
position, many of which seem to be held by faculty at the Graduate
Library School at the time, had on the development of library science
and library science education.</p>
<p><strong>Reflection:</strong> The use of the term *book* in this
article strikes me in a certain way. There does not seem to be an
attachment to the object other than for its ability to disseminate
information, which is a term the author explicitly uses (see previous
quote). If this same author were writing today, I think she could be
writing about other formats and media as easily as she writes about the
book. It's here, I think, that I see some of the first moves toward the
abstraction of content away from the object that holds or contains that
content. If I'm reading this correctly, this article is an extremely
forward-thinking piece.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Already, the focus on the user:</p>
<blockquote>
Can cataloging, for example, be taught from the standpoint of the user
of the catalogue, not from the standpoint of the maker of the catalogue
(p. 286)?
</blockquote>
<p>The rest of the paragraph is genius. Consider the following, in which
the stress on the defense of the decision-making of cataloguers
highlights the importance of such decisions--this is essentially about
the application of a rational framework, a <em>science</em>, to the
work:</p>
<blockquote>
As a further illustration, could the prospective administrator study
cataloguing with the problem of administration in mind, asking the
cataloguers to defend the cataloguing decisions that they are making ...
(p. 286)?
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Just an historical note about the trends in
"library architecture" (a term the author uses to describe a type of
social architecture regarding the division of the library) and about the
topic of subject specialists:</p>
<blockquote>
If, as present trends indicate, the future library is to be subdivided
by subject rather than by department, is it not the task of the library
school to prepare librarians who can become specialists in the subjects
(p. 287)?
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> How does this change the meaning, when
substituting <em>information</em> for <em>book</em>:</p>
<p>Original:</p>
<blockquote>
The readers want book aid from those who know books (p. 287).
</blockquote>
<p>Revised:</p>
<blockquote>
The readers want *information* aid from those who know
<em>information</em> (p. 287).
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Reflection:</strong> It is important for this author that
librarians have subject knowledge related to an area where they assist
readers. Secondary graduate degrees are not mentioned (so far) but
undergraduate education is, and thus the quality of undergraduate
education will have a substantial impact on the quality of
librarianship. Our field, therefore, should be very concerned with the
quality of higher education in general, above and beyond the normal
amount of attention that might be directed toward it.</p>
<p>The author seems to make this point in the next paragraph:</p>
<blockquote>
The library school attached to a university or college [not all were at
the time] has an opportunity to direct students in the same institution
before they enter the professional school and can accomplish something
by correspondence with those prospective students in other institutions
(pp. 287-288).
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Reflection:</strong> My one problem with this attention to
subject specialization rests on my argument that the methods used by
librarians (or information professionals in general) should be
generalized enough that subject knowledge is necessary in mostly a
trivial way. Such generalized skills of the librarian should help that
librarian switch to different subject matters if necessary. That kind of
flexibility seems to me to be a necessary condition of being a
professional--for librarians at least, whose subject matter is largely
the methods they need. For example, the signals that highlight the
quality of an article or book in philosophy should be comparable to the
signals that highlight the quality of an article or book in biology.
Understanding those signals, and how to use and manipulate them to
retrieve good information, seems to me to be the important matter.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Interesting this list on the requirements of
the librarian:</p>
<blockquote>
Common sense, tact, courtesy, poise, administrative ability, speed,
accuracy, reliability, initiative, are all essential; but the greatest
of all is good judgment in relating books to readers (p. 289).

This seems fairly evident in the articles the GLS faculty are publishing
in this first volume of <em>LQ</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Reflection:</strong> In many ways, reading these early issues
sometimes doesn't feel like I'm reading articles that were published
more than 80 years ago. For example, this article is about the
interdisciplinary nature of library science as well as cooperative
research. I've been reading about this topic recently and the arguments
are much the same.</p>
<p>Should I be expecting change? Should things be very different than
they were 80 years ago?</p>
<p>Part of the answer lies in the fact that these articles were written
in a time that I believe introduces the age that library science
functions today, in a paradigmatic kind of way. So that, we're simply
still operating under the same assumptions and frameworks and with many
of the same problems as they were in 1931. Despite all the change, it
really hasn't changed all that much.</p>
<p>Also, and in this particular paper, what I'm reading about is
reflective of what Robert K. Merton writes about. That is, problems of
cooperative research are very much problems with the entire ethos of
science, which hasn't changed either.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The next part of the paper illustrates
examples that involve what could be useful to both sociology and library
science, and the specific examples concern the public and reading. A
good amount of research has been done in this area, in subsequent years,
but the questions Waples raises are still relevant.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Example of cooperative research Waples
proposes:</p>
<blockquote>
Since no reliable evidence on the status of reading within any given
adult publication has yet been produced, we have here a field of
investigation in which the student of reading and the sociologist should
co-operate to mutual advantage (p. 296).
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Waples mentions pre-testing and post-testing
in research (he doesn't use those terms though). I just find that
interesting, since it makes me aware that I don't know how long (social)
scientists have pre and post-tested:</p>
<blockquote>
The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thurstone_scale">Thurstone
scales</a> for the measurement of attitudes toward various current
issues might be readily applied before and after the reading of a given
book or article to secure such evidence (p. 297).
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Waples ends the article with an outline of the
four types of reading studies that he just illustrated and discussed in
the article. The outline includes the research problems that need to be
addressed and a brief description of how to measure those problems,
where appropriate. It's a nice list.</p>

href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/40039661">http://www.jstor.org/stable/40039661</a></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The sixth article of the third issue of
<em>The Library Quarterly</em> is titled "The Public Library under the
City-Manager Form of Government (Continued)."</p>
<p>It was written by Carleton B. Joeckel, who was affiliated with:</p>
<p><strong>Affiliation:</strong> University of Michigan</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The first part of this article was published
in the second issue of this volume. My notes on that article are
here:</p>
<p><a
href="https://cseanburns.net/wiki/lq/volume-1-issue-2#article-1">https://cseanburns.net/wiki/lq/volume-1-issue-2#article-1</a></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Joeckel begins to write more in depth about
the various sorts of public library governance. The article has the
following sections:</p>
<ul>
<li>"CORPORATE LIBRARIES UNDER SELF-PERPETUATING BOARDS" (p. 301).</li>
<li>"LIBRARIES CONTROLLED BY ASSOCIATIONS AND CLUBS" (p. 302).</li>
<li>"MUNICIPAL PUBLIC LIBRARIES UNDER CONTROL OF THE CITY MANAGER" (p.
304).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Note</strong> About corporate (public) libraries. Legally,
they are corporations. In practice, they are not much different than
libraries governed by city councils:</p>
<blockquote>
The important point, of course, is that the governing boards of these
libraries are created by special state statutes and that their members
appoint their own successors. They are thus completely independent,
legally, of the municipal government and are responsible only to
themselves for their own acts. However, this separateness is somewhat
fictitious, since the city council has the power of the purse and can
alter its appropriations to the library as it sees fit (p. 301).
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> About libraries controlled by associations and
clubs. This form of management had been common. The two libraries under
investigation here are the Portsmouth Public Library, which</p>
<blockquote>
is controlled by the Ladies' Library Association of that city, which
elects a board of twelve members to manage the library. Even here,
however, there is a certain amount of supervision by the director of
public welfare, who is a city official; and the annual report of the
library is forwarded to the city manager and city council (p. 303).
</blockquote>
<p>And the Flagler Memorial Library of Miami in Miami, Florida. This is
an interesting set up:</p>
<blockquote>
The Flagler Memorial Library of Miami seems almost to defy
classification. It has been placed in this group, because it is actually
managed by the Miami Woman's Club through its library committee. This
unusual arrangement is due to the fact that Henry Flagler originally
donated to the Woman's Club a piece of ground, stipulating that the club
should maintain a free reading-room. For over twenty-five years the
library thus established served as the only public library of Miami, a
membership fee of $1.00 a year being charged. It has received financial
support from the city only since 1924, at which time it assumed the
functions of a free public library. Curiously enough, the present annual
appropriation of $30,000 is paid from the publicity fund of the city (p.
303).
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> About public libraries controlled by the city
manager:</p>
<p>Interesting tidbit about "newest type of municipal executive":</p>
<blockquote>
We now turn to a group of cities in which this tradition of independence
has been broken down, in which the newest type of municipal executive,
the city manager, has been definitely given authority over the destinies
of the public library (p. 304).
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Joeckel divides this group into two
subgroups:</p>
<ul>
<li>"those in which the library is merely a municipal department headed
by a single executive, the librarian, who is directly under the city
manager;"</li>
<li>"second, those libraries in which the library board has been
retained as an intermediate authority between the manager and the
librarian" (p. 305).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> There's a lot of detail in the following
pages, and it's not important for me (for this project) to note it all,
but the details reveal a fascinating history of early 20th century
public libraries.</p>
<p>However, one of the important points to be made is that libraries (at
this time) that did not have boards but that operated under a
city-manager seemed sometimes to be highly dependent on the
city-manager's level of attention on the library. That is, this form of
governance seems to result in an unpredictable situation for the library
as it not only depends on whether the city manager cares but also on
whether the city manager is involved. Ah, so Joeckel says as much
here:</p>
<blockquote>
The whole matter may well be summed up by saying the success of the
library under the direct supervision of the manager depends very largely
on the attitude of the individual manager toward the library. Librarians
working under managers are practically a unit on this point, regardless
of whether their personal experience has been favorable or unfavorable.
If the manager believes thoroughly in the importance of libraries, he
usually has it in his power to see that the library in his city receives
adequate support and is efficiently administered. If he is indifferent,
or worse, there is little hope for progress in library service (p. 313).
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> This could be used to explain or as an example
of why a profession is important for the administration of libraries:
Joeckel notes that many of the problems with the city manager set up is
that many of the city managers (at least at the time) were engineers,
who, the author argues, may be more interested in their own projects
than they are in libraries. See top of p. 314.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Interesting note, hypothetical back and forth,
between what a city manager would want and what a librarian would want
in the form of oversight. See pp. 319-320.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> This is good. He lists the "principal
arguments in favor of separate library organization" beginning on page
321. They are:</p>
<ol>
<li>They have been successful, historical.</li>
<li>Library boards are made up by those in the community. Nice quote:
"The great value of the board is not that it will actually devise ways
and means for administering the library--that a wise board leaves to the
librarian it appoints--but rather that it is able to interpret the
community and its needs and ..." (p. 322). Also: "Or, as stated by
another librarian, 'a board is needed to interpret the library to the
community and the community to the library'" (pp. 322-3).</li>
<li>"Continuity of policy" (p. 323). And: "Continuity in policy
<em>is</em> important for a library, for it can ill adapt itself to
violent and sudden changes in income, in management, or in service" (p.
323).</li>
<li>"Separate library administration will probably permit the library to
be considered a part of the educational system of the community, which
is not likely to be the case when it is entirely absorbed into the
general municipal organization" (p. 324).</li>
<li>Regarding the profession: "the library staff is more likely to
receive the special professional treatment which it requires under
separate control than as a part of the general municipal personnel" (p.
324).</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Joeckel then provides the arguments that have
favored a city manager administration. I won't list them, but they're
interesting.</p>
<p>However, there are some important remarks on taxation -- including
whether there should be a separate library tax or whether funds for
libraries should come out of a single tax.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> I really enjoy reading Carleton Joeckel. This
is a nice final line:</p>
<blockquote>
The age of experiment is not over in American municipal government, and
we are certainly not yet ready to abandon completely the idea of the
independence of the public library (p. 329).

<p>Carnovsky, Leon. (1931). Suggestions regarding an Evaluation of
Methods in Current Adult-Education Practices. <em>The Library Quarterly,
1</em>(4), 377-393. url:<a
href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/40039683">http://www.jstor.org/stable/40039683</a></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The first article of the fourth issue of
<em>The Library Quarterly</em> is titled "Suggestions regarding an
Evaluation of Methods in Current Adult-Education Practices."</p>
<p>It was written by Leon Carvovsky, who was affiliated with:</p>
<p><strong>Affiliation:</strong> Graduate Library School, University of
Chicago</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Seems there will be some criticism of adult
education, at least as it was represented as a movement at the time.
Also mentions, off the bat, education psychology.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> I've read about the use of forums in American
history before and have a general idea where the article I read is
located, but this bit connecting adult education and
<strong>forums</strong> is interesting and new to me, when presented in
this way:</p>
<blockquote>
One of the best-known forms of adult education in America is the forum.
The forum goes back a considerable distance in American history, and it
has achieved some prominence in recent times through being linked up
with the adult-education movement. Indeed, owing to this connection, it
is probable that the public forum is more extensive today in American
than it has ever been in the past. The main features of the forum are
three. There is an address, usually by a fluent-speaker, often one who
has achieved some distinction in his field, sometimes one who has become
popular through his facility of expression rather than his scholarship.
Sometimes a debate between two prominent persons is substituted for the
address. Following the address the meeting is open to the audience, and
questions relating to the topic of the evening are asked of the speaker.
Sometimes these are written, more often oral (p. 378).
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Carnovsky has the following bit on learning,
and I think given the relationship between public libraries and
learning, the following list should be considered in any in-depth
discussion of that relationship. He writes:</p>
<blockquote>
It remains now to ask what evidence is at hand for an evaluation of the
aims and method of the forum as described. One type of such evidence
consists in the principles that are known to operate in the learning
process. It is both possible and convenient to consider these principles
as representing at least eight types of learning, which are of course by
no means discrete:
1. Acquisition of acts of skill
2. Developing adequate perceptions and habits of observation
3. Acquiring associations and memorizing
4. Acquiring ideas or knowledge
5. Gaining understanding and problem-solving
6. Developing appreciations
7. Developing attitudes
8. Developing character (p. 379).
</blockquote>
<p>He then relates <strong>forums</strong> to item 4 on the list, at
least that is what they predominantly seem to be about. Then he uses
"psychological evidence" to support this claim. Interesting.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> There may be an exception or two, but I don't
think I'll report more details about this article any further in this
post. But, a few things to note:</p>
<ul>
<li>There is a very real purpose in this article, and that is to get
researchers to know more, to measure more, and so forth, what is going
on in adult learning. The beginning of this article is focused on
forums, but I imagine (I'm still reading) that Carnovsky will address
other types of learning formats.</li>
<li>The idea of a forum, as described in this article, is relevant in
today's context. This is because his description of forums and their
purpose has a conceptual relationship, although obviously antecedent, to
how MOOCs are presented today.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> On the "university extension movement" and
distance education over 80 years ago:</p>
<blockquote>
In general, the purpose of university extension is to take, in so far as
possible, the university to the student who is unable to attend in
person (p. 387).
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Description of correspondence instruction:</p>
<blockquote>
The method of instruction is correspondence. In general, the procedure
is as follows: definitely organized lesson sheets are sent to the
student at certain intervals. Assignments consist of required reading
and suggested readings, and exercises which are mailed back to the
university for correction or criticism, after which they are returned to
the student. There is, of course, no personal supervision in the sense
of a face-to-face relationship, but it would be a mistake to assume that
personal direction is lacking. On the contrary such direction is very
much a part of the system (p. 388).
</blockquote>
<p>I wonder if that's the first instance of the phrase
<em>face-to-face</em>--especially in nearly the same context we use it
today.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Carnovsky finally describes how libraries and
librarians have been involved in adult education. This was largely
through reader advisory, or the personalized reading list for the
patron. There is some criticism of this as a way of instruction. Here
Carnovsky quotes a "Professor L. J. Richardson, director of the
University of California Extension Division," who concludes after
providing a list of reasons why readers advisory is not a good
instructional program:</p>
<blockquote>
It is evidence that a course of reading, however carefully planned,
cannot meet all the needs involved in adult education (p. 392).
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> One last note about the article and especially
its method. Carnovsky's method is to describe the thing under question,
or the *data* as he terms it, and then tie the description to a
psychological statement or principle about learning. This makes his
*preface* intelligible (that is, I didn't understand what he was doing
when I first read it):</p>
<blockquote>
NOTE ON SOURCES:--Data concerning practices in adult education are found
in the "Studies in adult education," sponsored by the Carnegie
Corporation, as indicated in the footnotes. The psychological principles
employed were taken from the unpublished "Official record of the
Commonwealth Teacher Training Study," by Charters and Waples. The
principles were selected from over one hundred texts in educational
psychology by \[...\], as supported by experimental evidence (p. 377).
</blockquote>
<p>From the perspective of an up and coming social scientist who works
at the Graduate Library School, i.e., Carnovsky, this method is a really
interesting tactic.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> The second article of the fourth issue of
<em>The Library Quarterly</em> is titled "To What Extend Do the Students
of the Liberal-Arts Colleges Use the Bibliographic Items Given on the
Catalogue Card?"</p>
<p>It was written by Susan Grey Akers, who was affiliated with:</p>
<p><strong>Affiliation:</strong> University of North Carolina</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> It's long been about service and users:</p>
<blockquote>
The implication of the foregoing quotation is that in order to make a
good catalogue it is necessary to know the needs of the users of that
catalogue [...] (p. 394).
</blockquote>
<p>The "foregoing quotation" is from the following source (quoted from
the first endnote on page 394 of this article):</p>
<blockquote>
W. M. Randall, "The Uses of library catalogs," *Catalogers' and
classifiers' yearbook, II (1930), 26-27.
</blockquote>
<p>Since the above comment and quote are so interesting, given the time,
I just did a quick search for W. M. Randall's article and I came across
a piece I remember reading quite a while ago:</p>
<p>Connaway, Lynn S., Johnson, Debra W., &amp; Searing, Susan E. (1997).
<a href="http://crl.acrl.org/content/58/5/403.abstract">Online Catalogs
from the Users' Perspective: The Use of Focus Group Interviews</a>.
<em>College &amp; Research Libraries, 58</em>(5), 403-420.</p>
<p>In the Connaway, Johnson, and Searing article, they write:</p>
<blockquote>
The origin of catalog use studies is credited to a 1930 paper written by
William M. Randall. Randall contended that catalogs cannot be improved
by studying catalog rules or the catalogs themselves but, rather, by
studying catalog users needs, backgrounds, and mental capabilities (p.
404).
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> This is a really interesting piece. The author
is describing the use of pilot studies, collecting data by interviewing
students or asking the students to maintain diaries. The decided way to
collect data involved students completing checklists about their
interaction with the catalog.</p>
<p>Two hundred and fifty-seven students completed checklists.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Akers suggests that her study should be
generalizable to all liberal arts college students. How she tests this
is really interesting:</p>
<blockquote>
The reliability of these students as a sample of the students in
liberal-arts colleges was tested by correlating the votes of one-half
the students from each college with the votes of the other half of the
students from each college in order to see if the group was homogeneous
(p. 397).
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The research involved asking students what
part of the card they used. Akers then ranked the results. One finding,
for example, is that students ranked the <strong>Date of book</strong>
information as the most important information on the card, and the
<strong>Series notes for all series</strong> information as the least
important (see Table II, p. 399).</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Akers now reports student comments. I like
this one:</p>
<blockquote>
2. I should like to see a card system arranged so that an average
individual not having been in the library before could find a book ....
<strong>without having to bother the librarian for the required
information</strong>. As for the cards, I do not believe that the
thousand-and-one abbreviations used can be understood by anyone but a
librarian. Why not simplify the entire system? It can be done \[emphasis
added\] (p. 405).
</blockquote>
<p>Emphasis added because it just shows that students have never wanted
to go to the librarian. This is a universal law!</p>
<p><strong>Reflection:</strong> UNIVERSAL LAW OF LIBRARIES I: Students
dislike requesting assistance from librarians.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> More wish list for the card catalog:</p>
<blockquote>
11. I should like to suggest that in the case of books of reference the
position of the author be stated so that one might infer what authority
the book carries if one is not acquainted with the author (p. 406).
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> All librarians will nod their heads at this
request:</p>
<blockquote>
34. Color of the book (p. 407).
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Reflection:</strong> A really interesting piece--background,
methods, data collection, findings, conclusion (not described here). The
article involved a very short literature review because there was only
one article on the topic before this one (the Randall piece, see
above).</p>

the author's description of the problem is insightful and almost
mathematical. Or maybe it's just my reading of it. Anyhow, the author's

<p>Randall, William M. (1931). The College-Library Book Budget. <em>The
Library Quarterly, 1</em>(4), 421-435. url:<a
href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/40039686">http://www.jstor.org/stable/40039686</a></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The fourth article of the fourth issue of
<em>The Library Quarterly</em> is titled "The College-Library Book
Budget."</p>
<p>It was written by William M. Randall, who was affiliated with:</p>
<p><strong>Affiliation:</strong> Graduate Library School, University of
Chicago</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> An opening attack on how book budgets are
applied at college libraries. A really good attack. For example, on
spending money based on student population per department:</p>
<blockquote>
It appears obvious, for example, that the number of students enrolled in
courses in economics in College A can have no possible effect upon the
number of authoritative and necessary books published during a year in
the subject (p. 421).
</blockquote>
<p>The second argument is an argument against lapsing or <em>use it or
lose it</em> budgets.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Randall claims that knowing two pieces of
information would help solve the book budgeting problem:</p>
<ol>
<li>Average cost of book per academic deparment</li>
<li>Average number of books published per academic department per year
(see p. 422).</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Reflection:</strong> I think this is the first truly obsolete
article I've read in these first issues of <em>LQ</em>. Randall's <a
href="https://cseanburns.net/wiki/lq/volume-1-issue-1#article-9">previous
article</a> is relevant in many ways, but this one may be so only for
historical purposes.</p>
<p>I should add that I do not meant to minimize the importance of this
article. In fact, I think this article's lack of currency suggests that
this is an area (collection management) that library science has truly
advanced.</p>
<p>I'm enjoying this article so much. This is great (simpler times):</p>
<blockquote>
But, since the list has 149 titles in economics during one interval, and
275 titles in English during the corresponding interval, it seems
reasonable to suppose that the college library will need to buy, on the
average, about twice as many titles in English as in economics during a
given period (exactly 275/149) (p. 425).
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Essentially, what Randall is suggesting is a
collection development algorithm based on normalizing around the number
of books published in the field of *English*. It's original and
ingenious and fun to read. The method he proposes is also very thorough
and well thought out, even if outdated.</p>
<p>For example, it's coming out in the article that one of the benefits
of his method is that it highlights discrepancies in funding and
collections. Thus, his method could have been used to highlight what is
a fair distribution of books per academic department.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> And here's the kicker. This is what the
<em>LQ</em> is all about--a *Library Science*, at least in these early
years:</p>
<blockquote>
This article is intended not as a final word on any of the questions of
which it treats. It is intended rather as an introduction and a sample
of the sort of work which may be done upon the problems of the college
library--and upon all library problems in general--by the use of methods
which have been tested in other disciplines; and by the utilization of
available data which can be proved reliable. It would appear that the
proper procedure for the library profession at this time is not to seek
in every case practical and immediate application of knowledge to
everyday problems, so much as to investigate hypotheses, and to test the
assumption upon which the profession works (p. 435).

<p><strong>Note:</strong> The fifth article of the fourth issue of

<p>It was written by Claude H. Christensen, who was affiliated with:</p>
<p><strong>Affiliation:</strong> Graduate Library School, University of
Chicago</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Begins with praise of the order in
Scandinavian libraries and proceeds to discuss their history.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> There is one theme that I seem to find across
many different types of library histories. The problems that have
plagued libraries, especially around the middle to later part of the
19th century, is this: library methods could not scale with increased
communication. In order to meet that challenges, they discarded,
revised, and invented new methods to scale up. In this article's
context:</p>
<blockquote>
The works of Francke, Ebert, Schrettinger, and others excited a renewed
interest in library methods, which were proving quite inadequate for the
proper handling of the growing collections (p. 440).
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Reflection:</strong> I enjoy reading articles about the
development of classification systems, and this article is partly about
that. Articles like these remind me how historically situated and
culturally defined classification systems are.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> We may not have *rulers* anymore, but we still
have this problem and this outcome:</p>
<blockquote>
During the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries the fortunes of the
library depended largely upon the attitude of the rulers, and at times
there was little or no progress (p. 451).

<p><strong>Note:</strong> The first article of the first issue of the

<p>It was written by Louis R. Wilson, who was affiliated with:</p>
<p><strong>Affiliation:</strong> University of North Carolina</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Wilson's overall goal with this article is to
describe the state of affairs at the time. To set it up, he provides a
little history.</p>
<p>As the title suggests, the article is primarily about librarian
education, library schools, library faculty, library curricula, future
directions, and so forth.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> On library research and on the purpose of
library research.</p>
<blockquote>
Investigation in the library field will probably never be as exact as
that in the sciences. It may have to partake of the nature of
investigation in the social sciences and education. But it is essential
if librarians are to understand the point of view of workers in other
disciplines in the field, and if they are to increase the effectiveness
of the library as an educational and social instrument (p. 8).
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Not really relevant to anything I'm doing, but
I believe this is the first mention of the Depression in this study:</p>
<blockquote>
Just now, owing to the depression, difficulty is being experienced by
some of the schools in placing their graduates (p. 9).
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Still applicable today and, with a few word
substitutions, still current:</p>
<blockquote>
Similarly, librarians must be trained who will be effective in making
books available to rural populations, who undrstand the book needs of
patients in hospitals, who can elicit interest in books and support of
libraries through the radio, and who are skilled in co-ordinating and
guiding the various agencies which are engaged in general adult
education activities (pp. 9-10).

href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/4301859">http://www.jstor.org/stable/4301859</a></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The second article of the first issue of the
second volume of <em>The Library Quarterly</em> is titled "Library
Planning in Teacher-Training Institutions."</p>
<p>It was written by Donna E. Sullivan, who was affiliated with:</p>
<p><strong>Affiliation:</strong> State Normal School</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> An analysis of the various kinds of libraries
in service to teachers colleges.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Sullivan begins by highlighting the
contributions that <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_school">normal schools</a>
have made to teaching but notes that the model has become outdated and
there is currently a transition to the teachers college. In essence, the
transition is comparable to one from a vocational school to a four year
degree.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> With the rise in teacher colleges at the time,
Sullivan makes the argument that they will need good libraries to serve
their students. It's an argument for a library that fits the needs of a
particular college rather than an entire university.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Very interesting turn. The title of the
article <em>Library Planning</em> refers to actual space planning and
the arguments Sullivan provides are directed toward the good use of a
library, current and future. She incorporates blueprints to make her
point about certain arrangements. She even highlights "working
arrangements" (p. 15). So her concern is not just about library users
(including students and faculty) but also about library workers.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Longstanding tradition to have a library of
children's literature for teacher colleges:</p>
<blockquote>
Of the three rooms, the one at the front of the building is devoted to a
model children's library and is a non-circulating collection of books
used in the course in children's literature taken by the students in the
kindergarten-primary course. The middle room is known as the "children's
room," and here the children's librarian has her desk ... (p. 19).
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> I haven't read Matthew Griffis' dissertation
<a href="http://ir.lib.uwo.ca/etd/1103/">"Space, Power and the Public
Library: A Multicase Examination of the Public Library as Organization
Space"</a>, but I've heard him present a couple times (excellent
presenter and very interesting topic) about the use of space in public
libraries (within the context of <a
href="http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/foucault/">Michel Foucault</a>
and the <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panopticon">panopticon</a>). I
wonder how he'd comment on this passage, which suggests that the intent
is to place the library's desk in a location that helps library users
rather than librarians.</p>
<blockquote>
On the second floor the outstanding features are the librarian's desk in
the main delivery lobby, always visible and available; (p. 19).
</blockquote>
<p>(Just brought this up with a colleague who walked by my office and we
had a great conversation about it.)</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> I'm seeing a similar effect here at UK with
the construction of the new dormitories near the main library:</p>
<blockquote>
With the allotment of these rooms to other departments more use of the
library developed. The students no longer consider the walk from
classrooms to library a task, and the end of each class hour sees great
numbers of them going to and from between the buildings (p. 29).
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> There's a line at the top of page 35 that
makes me wonder whether the design of academic libraries in cities may
have been influenced by the needs of students commuting to the city from
suburbia -- who would have needed a place to read and study while they
were on campus.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The argument for the library's central
position / location on a campus is essentially an argument about equal
access to information, except from geographic perspective:</p>
<blockquote>
In planning a building for the library of a teachers college, a number
of important points immediately come to mind. A central location is
desirable, that all students from the various other buildings and
departments may reach the library in approximately the same time and
share equally in having "first choice" of the books in demand.
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The reserve room makes its appearance into the
library:</p>
<blockquote>
With the present methods of instruction, where individual textbooks have
been retired into the background and students are referred to a number
of books for each course, need for housing these books constantly in
demand in one place has become a necessity, and the reserve-book room
has appeared upon the scene to fill this need (p. 36).
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The expected (at that time) life expectancy of
a library building (at least at a teachers college):</p>
<blockquote>
In planning a library building a careful estimate of the maximum
possible growth of the student numbers and library books should be used
as a basis on which to compute the needs for the next few decades. To
plan for a few years is not sufficient; new libraries do not drop down
into outstretched hands whenever the olds ones become crowded, and a new
building must serve for thirty, forty, or fifty years (p. 39).
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> I still occasionally hear about problems when
one doesn't listen to the other.</p>
<blockquote>
Hearty co-operation between the architect and the librarian is a state
to be encouraged, and a most satisfactory library can be the result of
united effort on the part of these two, with, of course, certain
concessions on the part of both (pp. 40-41).
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Reflection:</strong> This is an insightful article. According
to <em>Google Scholar</em>, it's only been cited twice. That's a
shame.</p>

href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/4301860">http://www.jstor.org/stable/4301860</a></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The third article of the first issue of the
second volume of <em>The Library Quarterly</em> is titled "The Relation
of Subject Interests to Actual Reading."</p>
<p>It was written by Douglas Waples, who was affiliated with:</p>
<p><strong>Affiliation:</strong> University of Chicago</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> There are only three articles in this issue,
but the articles are quite lengthy. The remaining issues for this volume
have about five or six articles each.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> This is the fourth article by Douglas Waples.
He had articles published in the first three issues of the first volume
and now the first issue of the second volume.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Waples, if I recall from past readings of his
work, continues to push the idea that other disciplines (e.g.,
education, political science, etc.) will find library science research
relevant and fruitful for their own work. He does so explicitly but also
by stating that LS research is not just "technical":</p>
<blockquote>
If it be assumed that the reading desired by a group is both authentic
and important, the investigation may also be significant for educators,
political scientists, and students of social welfare. Hence the work
herein reported should not be regarded as of merely technical interest
(p. 42).
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Nice outline of the "conditions affecting
satisfaction in reading" (p. 44). He uses the propositions in this
outline to ask the following research question (so to speak):</p>
<blockquote>
How may one proceed to increase the satisfactions obtainable from
reading (p. 45)?
</blockquote>
<p>And his method is very analytical, well-described, and even
pedagogical (which might be purposeful):</p>
<blockquote>
The answer we propose has three parts. First, we can separate the
conditions that can *not* be directly controlled, such as the reader's
desire to read on particular subjects, from the conditions that *can* be
controlled to some extend, such as the appeal of the reading matter
itself and its accessibility (p. 45).
</blockquote>
<p>Then:</p>
<blockquote>
Second, we can find out for each of several typical groups of readers
what sort of reading is defined by the conditions that cannot be
controlled (p. 45).
</blockquote>
<p>Last:</p>
<blockquote>
Third, we can modify certain other conditions to whatever extent is
needed in order (*a*) to increase the supply of reading that meets the
indicated demand and (<em>b</em>) to make it more accessible (p. 45).
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The conditions Waples believes are the most
relevant to reading satisfaction:</p>
<blockquote>
What is practicable, however, is a possibility rendered plausible by
data presented in this report; namely, that three of the conditions
mentioned are so much more influential than other conditions in their
effects upon the satisfaction obtained from actual reading that the
others may be disregarded for practical purposes (p. 46).
</blockquote>
<p>Then:</p>
<blockquote>
These conditions, for the general reader, are probably subject interest,
readability, and accessibility (p. 46).
</blockquote>
<p>And why these conditions are also important for research and
practicing purposes:</p>
<blockquote>
All three may in time be sufficiently controlled to increase very
considerably the amount of satisfactory literature available to various
populations. That is to say, the material on the preferred subjects can
be increased in amount, its methods of treatment can be better adjusted
to the given readers, and it can be more widely advertised (p. 46).
</blockquote>
<p>And why (and a sort of prediction that he makes):</p>
<blockquote>
Such measures would increase the readers' satisfaction, since the
correspondence between the subjects of most interest and the subjects
most read about becomes close when the actual reading is reduced to
material which (1) includes the given subjects, (2) is attractively
written, and (3) is easily accessible (p. 46).
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The next section is titled
<strong>PROCEDURE</strong>. I'd have to go back and look but I'm fairly
confident that this is the first instance of a clearly defined methods
section. I do remember that previous <em>LQ</em> articles did have
ill-defined sections or parts that described the methods used but not as
explicitly as this.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Waples begins by repeating his research
question:</p>
<blockquote>
With so much by way of perspective, we may attack the central
question---What is the relation of actual reading to subject interest?
In other words, to what <strong>extent</strong> is the reading done by a
typical group of adults concerned with subjects upon which the group
expresses most desire to read [emphasis added] (p. 46)?
</blockquote>
<p>Then Waples succinctly describes how he will answer this
question:</p>
<blockquote>
To answer this question it is necessary, first, to discover what
subjects are interesting and uninteresting as such; then, to determine
how much material is actually read upon each subject; and, finally, to
make the comparison (pp. 46-47).
</blockquote>
<p>Then he ends the paragraph with a nod to a <strong>FINDINGS</strong>
section (it begins on page 55). This signifies to me that it is his
intent to title his sections so explicitly. This marks an explicit turn
in the literature---a marked change in the evolution of library studies
as a <em>library science</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
The three steps will be discussed in turn to explain the method of
procedure. The section on "findings" presents the evidence (p. 47).
</blockquote>
<p>It will be interesting to note how long it takes before this literary
turn takes off in future articles.</p>
<p>In any case, this is an important step in the literature.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The first thing Waples does in the procedure
section is list a number of possible ways to answer his research
question, but point by point he points out their deficiencies. He then
makes the case that although any one method may be deficient (or
impractical), a combination of these methods may result in valid
findings. He rejects a couple of the methods, and uses a combination of
three others.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The purpose here is not necessarily to comment
on any findings, but here's something I think is interesting, mostly
because it's still somewhat the case today, although it may play out in
various channels:</p>
<blockquote>
Of the fiction read by men and women combined, it was possible to
identify the authors of 186 titles. Of these, 55 were sensational
stories of the news stand variety that would scarcely appear on
public-library shelves (p. 63).
</blockquote>
<p>Also, Waples lists the 19 non-fiction titles on pages 63--64.
Fascinating list. I'd like to know how many of those books were passed
back and forth among the readers.</p>
<p><strong>Reflection:</strong> Waples' material continues to be
interesting reading. I will need to investigate whether this is the
first instance of <strong>PROCEDURE</strong> and
<strong>FINDINGS</strong> sections.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> This is essentially a report of the
conference. It begins with a short (and nice) recent history of the
libraries in the UK.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Interesting tidbit about library workers
related to library quality, or the view thereof:</p>
<blockquote>
It is not for nothing that the great advance in serious public esteem of
the public library in the last fifteen or twenty years has coincided
with the raising of the standard of entry of junior assistants from the
age of fourteen or fifteen to that of seventeen or eighteen, i.e., from
children leaving elementary schools to those leaving secondary (high)
schools with at least university matriculation (p. 100).
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Then some comments on the effects of Andrew
Carnegie's philanthropy.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Esdaile recounts <a
href="https://cseanburns.net/wiki/lq/volume-2-issue-1#article-1">Louis
R. Wilson's</a> presentation of his paper on "Aspects of education for
librarianship" (p. 101). <a

Williamson</a> is also mentioned. The author writes, in reference to
what Wilson said:</p>
<blockquote>
He thought that the staffing of the great libraries needed scientific
thinking out and that members of such staffs should have training in
scientific research (p. 102).
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The mention of a journal I've never heard of:
<em>Library Association Record</em> (p. 102), which according to
<em>Ulrichsweb</em>, became <em>Library + Information Update</em> in
2002 after merging with <em>Inform</em>. This of course corresponds to
the merging of the <em>Library Association</em> with the <em>Institute
of Information Scientists</em> in 2002.</p>
<p><a
href="https://cseanburns.net/wiki/lq/volume-1-issue-3#article-1">W. W.
Bishop</a> is also mentioned, in reference to a pre-conference
<em>International Federation of Library Associations</em> (IFLA)
meeting.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Wilson, Williamson, and Bishop represent
connections as previous, early authors of *LQ*. This could be why
Esdaile is familiar with <em>The Library Quarterly</em> (and is
publishing in it). In fact, Esdaile attended the IFLA meeting that
Wilson and Bishop attended (the latter becoming IFLA's second
president). It's currently unknown, to me, how well disseminated
<em>LQ</em> was at this time, only half way through its second volume.
The conference took place in August 1931 and there is no submission date
attached to this piece. Esdaile was elected as an IFLA vice-president
along with Marcel Godet, who became IFLA's third president, and Bishop
who became the second president. Quick IFLA past president <a

<p><strong>Note:</strong> The second article of the second issue of the
second volume of <em>The Library Quarterly</em> is titled "What Library
Schools Are Not."</p>
<p>It was written by Ernest J. Reece, who was affiliated with:</p>
<p><strong>Affiliation:</strong> Columbia University</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> With some history of the library school. It's
early purpose, Reece argues:</p>
<blockquote>
Some device was needed to turn more people into library work, and that
quickly. The one adopted, namely, the library school, became by
pre-emption and default the agency not alone for training but in large
degree that for recruiting, selecting, measuring, apprenticing, and
placing (p. 107).
</blockquote>
<p>Then:</p>
<blockquote>
Diversity of function, therefore, is a thing by which the library
schools of today have come honestly, and which, incidentally, there is
no likelihood that they ever can abandon wholly (p. 107).
</blockquote>
<p>And the purpose of this paper:</p>
<blockquote>
It is fitting to consider, however, to what extent present conditions
warrant its persistence. In doing so, the several offices referred to
above will be touched in sequence (p. 107).
</blockquote>
<p>By offices, Reece means the actions listed above: recruiting,
selecting, measuring, apprenticing, and placing.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> This is an important line of argument that
gives credence to the argument that library schools should not be
vocational schools:</p>
<blockquote>
It is to be remembered, however, that school conditions differ signally
[significantly?] from field situations in general and violently from
specific field situations, that the circumstances and incentives in a
school year for a given student are often abnormal, and that predictions
based on school performance therefore are not to be made with certainty
(p. 109).
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> In short, Reece's final note:</p>
<blockquote>
The positive principle inescapable in any thoroughgoing consideration of
school activities is that the first and last duty of a school is to
instruct. This is true for library schools as well as for schools of
other types; and in the case of library schools, the time has come to
assert it, and perhaps to shout it, rather than merely to allow it (p.
111).
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Reflection:</strong> It's helpful (and suggestive by the
author) to read this article by keeping in mind the difference between
and the evolution of the library school of the 1880s and 1890s with the
library school of the 1930s.</p>

libraries have truly progressed, at least in practice, and the
advancement in this area is partially due to the ease of fulfilling
these requests (the available infrastructure, broadly envisioned).</p>
<p>Although I have experienced a library denying a request of mine (it
is rare), I cannot imagine that it would be acceptable as a matter of
routine today:</p>
<blockquote>
To be sure, we restricted our own requests to books for use in serious
research; only once did we attempt to borrow a book for an
undergraduate, an exceptional case in which the student was doing what
amounted to Master's degree research (even then we were refused the
loan) (p. 113).
</blockquote>
<p>Notice, also, the level of expectation and the level of regulation or
gatekeeping in the above passage. The librarian neither expects to
receive a request nor to fulfill a request. Further, requests are only
really considered in matters of <em>serious research</em>. This meant
that the librarian had to make a judgement call about the
<em>seriousness</em> of the patron's needs and that there existed a kind
of a decision rule with regards to undergraduates --- that their
information needs will rarely be greater than the cost to request a loan
from another library.</p>
<p>Given this, however, the purpose of this article involves finding a
way to progress in this matter---to give more attention to the
information needs of all patrons. I know a little of this history, but
it would be worthwhile to investigate more deeply---to see what
documentation existed that discussed this matter.</p>
<p><strong>Reflection:</strong> There is in this article a really
important lesson about information expectations. We expect it to be free
and quickly accessible today. Tracing these expectations, from a history
of ideas perspective, would be an important research topic.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Two important statements and several important
implications in this passage:</p>
<blockquote>
One library reported that in certain cases faculty members and graduate
students are enabled to visit other libraries by a fund provided for
that purpose.
</blockquote>
<p>And the rest of the paragraph and second important statement:</p>
<blockquote>
One southern college for negroes reported that they borrowed freely, "as
libraries in the South are not always open to us"---which tells its own
story (p. 120).
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> On privacy:</p>
<blockquote>
Only 19 (9.3 per cent) replied that they required the name of the reader
for whom the material was borrowed, while 167 (82.2 per cent) answered
that they did not do so (p. 121).
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> On the use of union catalogs:</p>
<blockquote>
Borrowers are now better able to learn where their books may be
obtained; the <strong>Union list of serials</strong> definitely locates
periodical holdings, and requests for these may be diversified; some
localities have regional union lists of serials; there are certain
printed aids showing the location of books in special fields (p. 123).
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> On the accessibility of information. There is
an important relationship here between accessibility and expectations
(see note above):</p>
<blockquote>
Consider for a moment the predicament of a library in New England with
one of its books lent to a California library. The book is needed at
home and must be recalled. A letter sent by regular mail would take five
days to reach the California library; air mail would take about two and
one-half days. One day would be lost in calling in the book and
preparing it for mailing, and the return trip would take not less than
seven days, usually more. This would mean a minimum of ten or eleven
days and a maximum of fourteen or more. Meanwhile the local borrower
must wait, usually not patiently. Or, for example, a book is absent from
a library on the East coast for ten days to two weeks longer when it is
lent to a library on the West coast than it is if it is lent anywhere in
the adjoining states or even slightly farther way (p. 123).
</blockquote>
<p>The beginning of the next paragraph:</p>
<blockquote>
Nevertheless, it is to the everlasting credit of American college
libraries that 139 (68.4 per cent) reported that they either lend, or
would lend if asked, books and periodicals to libraries at a great
distance from their own (p. 123).
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Although libraries overall seemed to suffer
from few losses, it did occur and mostly seemed to happen in relation to
the postal service. So this is kind of funny::</p>
<blockquote>
Nevertheless, there are losses, and it behooves each library to be as
careful as possible. Several libraries reported that they did not ship
books during the Christmas season, which is a wise precaution (p. 128).
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Who pays for interlibrary loans? The author
didn't ask this question but he writes that, fortunately, some libraries
provided this anyway. A couple more interesting scenarios:</p>
<blockquote>
1 library reported that professors paid the charges one way and that
students paid all charges (p. 129).
</blockquote>
<p>And:</p>
<blockquote>
One library, which originally paid all charges for the professors, made
a change in its policy two years ago, requiring the professors to pay
all charges; as a result there was a noticeable decrease in requests to
borrow (p. 129).
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> They weren't always a fan of interlibrary
loans, as one librarian wrote in:</p>
<blockquote>
Consumes much valuable time. It proves to be a costly practice in many
ways" (p. 130).
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Still an important consideration for any
school that builds a new program:</p>
<blockquote>
There is the problem of the college or university giving graduate work
without the necessary library equipment to care adequately for the needs
of its graduate students (p. 130).
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Article ends with a letter about a statewide
cooperative plan. Important ending and an important topic, one that
would eventually shape the future of library administration.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> This is a really neat history. Consider how
important a thesaurus was:</p>
<blockquote>
One gentleman, for instance, made a gift in 1849 to the Harvard Library
of a thesaurus, in four volumes, upon condition that he would have free
access to it at any time and that, in the event of having a son who
needed it, he might have the privilege of recovery (pp. 139-140).

It is difficult, in any discussion of early libraries, to eliminate the

<p>Uhlendorf, B. A. (1932). The Invention of Printing and Its Spread
till 1470: With Special Reference to Social and Economic Factors.
<em>The Library Quarterly, 2</em>(3), 179-231. url:<a
href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/4301902">http://www.jstor.org/stable/4301902</a></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The first article of the third issue of the
second volume of <em>The Library Quarterly</em> is titled "The Invention
of Printing and Its Spread till 1470: With Special Reference to Social
and Economic Factors."</p>
<p>It was written by B. A. Uhlendorf, who was affiliated with:</p>
<p><strong>Affiliation:</strong> University of Michigan</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> On research in early printing, its relation to
"scientific investigation" and on "connecting it to other fields of
human knowledge":</p>
<blockquote>
When one reviews the literature on early printing, which, since about
1900, has been a field of thorough scientific investigation, one cannot
but realize that the time has come when the student of incunabula must
enliven the product of his labors by relating it to other fields of
human knowledge (p. 179).
</blockquote>
<p>Uhlendorf claims that the "spiritual awakening" that took hold of
Europe before the invention of the printing press was a necessary
condition for the invention of the printing press.</p>
<p>And the rise of the city, in medieval society, was also a necessary
condition. The exchange of goods and services enabled the exchange of
print.</p>
<p>And the rise of the gild system in the city.</p>
<p>And the importance of the merchant at this time:</p>
<blockquote>
He [the merchant] provided himself with the new works at the spring and
fall fairs, and thus contributed his share toward the promulgation of
ideas (p. 182).
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> As today (i.e., the web), the importance of
"youth" to the rise and acceptance of printing:</p>
<blockquote>
The spirit of the German universities, if indeed their superannuated
scholasticism can be called "spirit," was lifeless, pedantic, factional,
and it was youth which revolted against ossification in its attempt to
open the gates of the universities to the new ideas, which many of them
had imbibed during years of study at Italian universities (pp. 185-186).
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> After describing the method of instruction
given by professors at the time (they spoke mostly from memory) and the
limited availability of poor copies of their lectures:</p>
<blockquote>
We feel that the great need for mechanical reproduction of manuscripts
was not so much an economic necessity as it was a dire need for
more---and, above all, for more correct---texts (p. 187).
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> This is relevant today, as an important
function of printing and the disruption of the web:</p>
<blockquote>
Indeed, the Chinese word for a print and for a seal is one and the same:
it implies authentication (p. 187).
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The author notes the importance of Chinese
experimentation with printing, preceding Gutenberg 400 years, and
paper-making.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> This is interesting: print as a new type face
or print as mimicry of handwriting:</p>
<blockquote>
While for Gutenberg it was an essential principle to reproduce
handwriting with great accuracy, even to imperfect line-endings,
Schoeffer abandoned this practice and did the best with the material he
had. Comparing, for example, his <strong>Durandus</strong> with
Gutenberg's <strong>Catholicon</strong>, one cannot but see that, while
to Schoeffer the letter was more or less a unit which merely contributed
toward forming a word, Gutenberg, like a copyist, must have considered
for his unit the word, using all sorts of tied letters and frequently
resorting to the file (p. 195).
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> On Peter Schoeffer:</p>
<blockquote>
Besides introducing into printing the practice of using colophons,
Schoeffer was the first to use more than one size of font of type in one
book (p. 195).
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Reflection:</strong> I keep wondering, who is Uhlendorf's
audience? Is it librarians? Is it library science scholars? An
interesting project would involve tracing this.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> More on Schoeffer and his contribution to
printing:</p>
<blockquote>
Schoeffer, on the other hand, gradually freed printing from too slavish
copying of manuscript books. He introduced almost perfect line-endings,
which, however, was also striven for by Pfister in his later works, even
if he had to divide a word in quite a ludicrous manner (p. 198).
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> This seems important in regards to the
universalizing (for lack of a better word at the moment) of print. That
is, what we have here could be at least an early kind of Copernican
Revolution, in the sense that the standardization of font and typeface
away from the idiosyncrasies of personal handwriting functioned to
de-personalize the author -- to make less provincial. Furthermore,
perhaps there is a relation here between the de-personalization of the
author with respect to print and Merton's <em>universalism</em> norm
with regards to the function of a scientist --- it's not the scientist
that is important, it is the science; it's not the author that is
important, it's the content. And for that content to be disseminated, it
could not be provincial or too personal or suffer from local
"archetypes."</p>
<blockquote>
While Gutenberg cut his types on local manuscript models and imitated
manuscripts even in the composition of the page, and while later
printers cut their own type after the style of writing of their region,
perhaps even after the book hand of the particular manuscript to be
copied, it is only natural that they should soon find out that it was
much easier to design new type after printing books. Moreover, when the
local market was well supplied and the sale of books began to depend
upon more distant localities, they probably found it necessary to use
fonts that were not of too local a character. In other words, the number
of archetypes (<strong>Urtypen</strong>), as Haebler calls them, became
less and less (p. 212).
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> On the beginnings of publishing houses:</p>
<blockquote>
Again very early there prevails a certain commercial aspect; the
<strong>business</strong> of printing became associated with the
<strong>art</strong> of printing. A master printer perhaps hired helpers
on short-term contracts, or even for the printing of a certain book
only; printers banded together to form organizations; scholars either
made financial arrangements with printers for the publication of one or
several works, or hired some artisan, financed the establishment of a
shop, and legally assured themselves of a certain percentage of the
earnings---in short, we have the beginning of the publishing business
(p. 225).
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> More on the universalism:</p>
<blockquote>
While the German printers tenaciously held to their local type faces,
the typographers of Italy, especially those of Venice, created
characters which could be adopted universally, for, indeed, they had to
count upon the sale of their works in all parts of Europe (p. 229).

<p><strong>Note:</strong> The second article of the third issue of the
second volume of <em>The Library Quarterly</em> is titled "Buch und
Bibliotheken unter der Perspektive Goethe / Goethe's Attitude toward
Books and Libraries."</p>
<p>It was written by Richard Oehler, who was affiliated with:</p>
<p><strong>Affiliation:</strong> Universitätsbibliothek Frankfurt am
Main / Frankfurt University Library</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The article is published in both German and
English -- alternating pages between each language. Interestingly, and I
don't know if this is common practice when journals do this, the page
numbers are continuous despite the breaks in language.</p>
<p><strong>Reflection:</strong> I wouldn't have guessed that I'd be
reading about Nietzsche, Shopenhauer, and Goethe in a library science
journal.</p>
<p><strong>Reflection:</strong> I think one reason why I keep returning
to the idea that the people of this era's experience is not much
different than ours, and that their questions are not much different
than ours, is because their experience of their own information
explosion is quite similar to our own experience of information
explosion. While their experience may have been a <a
href="https://cseanburns.net/wiki/lq/volume-1-issue-3#article-1">physical
one</a>, and ours a digital one, it seems qualitatively the same in many
ways. In fact, our experience seems entailed by theirs -- not
necessarily an inevitable outcome but a highly likely one.</p>
<blockquote>
One characteristic seems to distinguish our age from all that has gone
before; this is our vivid personal interest and deep-seated intellectual
curiosity in everything, men and objects, outside of ourselves (p. 233).
</blockquote>
<p>Then:</p>
<blockquote>
We strive to comprehend concrete reality and we reproduce more often
than we create. This is the source of our superabundance of factual
literature that endeavors to include the least detail. We are, above all
else, men who have read and have written excessively (p. 233).
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The book and the self; the book and
universalism. One of the most important statements on reading that I
have seen in our literature:</p>
<blockquote>
The book is one of the most important and---let us say it frankly---one
of the most baneful links between our intellectual and spiritual lives
and those of other men of the present and past. Without the book we
cannot get out of ourselves or back into what has gone before. A Crusoe
ideal of life would be madness. That is why we live with books and value
them as our very lives. We must thus value them, and yet we constantly
strive against them, for they carry a threat to "snuff out the vital
spark of independent thought" (p. 237).
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Doing and reading:</p>
<blockquote>
To Goethe action and reality are everything. "In the beginning was the
deed." He finds it impossible to grant equal value and dignity to the
word, which is written and read. And today, a century and a half later,
that is still the best description of the disharmony of our inner
spiritual life, real accomplishments versus literary production. Actual
deeds, on the one hand; the book, on the other---real life or the
book---present the same problem to us today as they did to Goethe (p.
239).
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Powerful stuff:</p>
<blockquote>
Goethe battled against excessive writing and excessive reading, much as
Shopenhauer and Nietzsche did later, and as much as the Old Testament
preacher, thousands of years before Goethe, with his plaint: "And
furthermore, my son, be admonished, of making many books there is no
end." Goethe, before all of his contemporaries, foresaw prophetically
the coming mass production of books" (p. 243).
</blockquote>
<p>And then he quotes two passages from Goethe, one on the production of
books and writings and the other on "voracious reader", which sounds
like a description of present-day times and the madness of production
(e.g., blogs):</p>
<blockquote>
And about the voracious reader:
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
Nowadays everybody reads, and many readers run through a book
precipitately, and then take pen in hand themselves to propagate with
remarkable facility a book of their own from the book just read! "Do you
want me, my friend, to write about other literary productions, and
thereby increase the existing mass of writing? Shall I thus spread my
views, to afford others an opportunity to proclaim
<strong>their</strong> views about <strong>my</strong> views, and thus
keep in action the swaying of the groaning scales?" (p. 243).
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> See my notes about the theme of
decentralization, which seems to be a result, as I'm coming to believe,
of the increased result of the production of information:</p>
<blockquote>
Possibly the almost insurmountable problems of space in the metropolitan
libraries of the future could be anticipated through the following
steps. Goethe disclaimed a desire to consolidate physically the
libraries of several cities, though they were close to one another. One
might easily conceive a plan to protect the metropolitan libraries of
the future from making accessions to the limit of possibility by
establishing special reserve stocks at certain points and thereby
relieving the burden of the central libraries. In that way one would, to
a certain extent, curb the tendency to a physical concentration in one
place, as is now the case. This thought can only be suggested here. In
actual experience its practicability will be increased more and more
with the amplification and multiplication and cheapening of the means of
transportation from city to city, from country to country, and across
the seas (p. 247).
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> And we are simply carrying out the work that
our predecessors began:</p>
<blockquote>
After all, what we are concerned with is "virtual consolidation"--we
always go back to Goethe--i.e., the possibility of encompassing the
material in libraries by means of catalogues, and, at the same time, of
making the deposits accessible and useful, whether in the local library
or elsewhere (pp. 247-249).
</blockquote>
<p>And:</p>
<blockquote>
Thus throughout the world an active effort is actually being made to
master, by means of bibliographic organization, the flood of scholarly
publications. At the time time this method will serve future
generations, as an organization of scholarship itself (p. 249).

<p><strong>Note:</strong> The third article of the third issue of the
second volume of <em>The Library Quarterly</em> is titled "The Student
Load in Library Schools."</p>
<p>It was written by Ernest J. Reece, who was affiliated with:</p>
<p><strong>Affiliation:</strong> Columbia University</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> This article should be interesting. The aim is
to simply gather an understanding of the norms around course loads. The
data is based on a survey sent to schools that are members of the then
Association of American Library Schools. Members of the individual
schools collected data in a number of ways, and Reece comments on this
in the first page or so of the article.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Here is one area that computers may have
helped solve or lessen the problem of:</p>
<blockquote>
There might seem to be an element of bad management in expecting the
student who has spent several hours on a book selection problem to
devote further hours to typing it (p. 253).
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Lot of discussion about what is a proper work
load for students. Good stuff but also ordinary. However, the gist of
Reece's argument can be summed up with this thoughtful closing
remark:</p>
<blockquote>
The aim should be to compose courses not only in such a way as to
obviate congestion and panic but so as to permit the serving of readily
assimilable rather than large portions, and so as to leave leisure for
the imagination of the student to play upon the material presented; and
finally to bring classes to the close of the year with a sense of having
done not too superficially the work undertaken, and with the vigor and
enthusiasm necessary for effective effort in the library field (p. 264).

Relation of the College Library to Recent Movements in Higher Education,

<p><strong>Note:</strong> This study was the result of quite a bit of
travel:</p>
<blockquote>
Although the great majority of the colleges studied are in the Central
West, information was gathered from institutions located in twenty-two
different states. All the data are based on information gathered by
personal visits in either the year 1928-29 or the year 1929-30. The
studies related to financial matters are based upon a painstaking
analysis of the accounts in the business offices of the institutions.
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> When did people stop using the median! It
seems common practice during this time (and more accurate than today's
common use of the mean):</p>
<blockquote>
Investigation as to the amount of expenditures for the library in the
various colleges included in this study showed that the median annual
expenditure per student for this purpose is $12.25. Institutions holding
the highest type of accreditation, i.e., those on the approved list of
the Association of American Universities, spend notably more per student
($14.21) than is spent by institutions not on the approved list ($9.03).
The typical sum spend for library services is 4 1/2-5 per cent of the
entire educational expenditure (p. 269).
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Quite a bit of discussion about how libraries
allocate book collection funds. One dominating practice of the day was
to allocate book collection funds by college department. Some libraries
even went the route of a flat tax--so that no matter the department, its
needs, or its use of the library, each department received the same base
allotment.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The authors discuss a number of important
factors in book fund allocation:</p>
<blockquote>
The development of a satisfactory distribution of book funds among
departments is actually a rather complicated matter. There are at least
six important factors to be taken into account in allocating funds for
new books to departments (p. 271).
</blockquote>
<ol>
<li>Distribution of students by department, per enrollment (pp.
271-272).</li>
<li>Distribution of use by library by department (p. 272).</li>
<li>Distribution of new publications by field of study (p. 272).</li>
<li>Distribution of "relative cost of books per volume unit in various
fields" (p. 273).</li>
<li>Nature of "existing conditions of the library collections in the
several fields" (p. 273).</li>
<li>The needs of new instructors: "A teacher who is just joining the
faculty will usually find that the library lacks several titles which he
considers important for the use of his classes" (p. 273).</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The authors comment on the above six
factors:</p>
<blockquote>
A review of the six factors which should be taken into account in
allotting funds for new books to various departments shows how complex
the problem is. Clearly, no cut-and-dried formula, applicable alike to
all institutions, can be expected to work satisfactorily. Two of the
factors--the amount of new material coming out in the several fields,
and the cost of books per volume unit in the several subjects--can well
be reduced to a constant which is valid for all colleges alike. Another
factor, the enrolments in the respective departments, can be reduced to
statistical terms; and the keeping of adequate circulation statistics
will yield valuable data on the relative use of library materials by the
several departments. The last two factors discussed--the existing
condition of the library collection, and the needs of new
instructors--require individual attention in each college (pp. 273-274).
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> An important comment, which I'm glad to see,
because it hasn't and will most likely always be this way:</p>
<blockquote>
A matter that complicates still further the allocation of book funds to
departments is the fact that colleges are utterly lacking in uniformity
in their departmental organization (p. 274).
</blockquote>
<p>And, they shouldn't be classified as such:</p>
<blockquote>
Furthermore, these departmental groupings do not correspond closely in
detail to the systems used in classifying library books (p. 274).
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> This problem went away a long time ago, but I
can see, for reasons I'll skip now, a possible resurgence:</p>
<blockquote>
A final problem relates to whether the funds allotted for the purchase
of new books for the several departments shall be considered a part of
the departmental budget or a part of the library budget (p. 275).

href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/4301906">http://www.jstor.org/stable/4301906</a></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The fifth article of the third issue of the
second volume of <em>The Library Quarterly</em> is titled "Four Great
Libraries of Medieval Baghdad."</p>
<p>It was written by Ruth Stellhorn Mackensen, who was affiliated
with:</p>
<p><strong>Affiliation:</strong> Hartford, Connecticut (No
affiliation)</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Begins with a brief overview of libraries in
Baghdad and their collections and then "describes four of the great
libraries of Baghdad and the institutions which housed them" (p.
280).</p>
<p>Nice paragraph:</p>
<blockquote>
Probably the most interesting aspect of these libraries is the important
place they held in the cultural life of the time. They were no musty
storehouses where books lay seldom used and at the mercy of ignorant
attendants. Instead, one sees them as centers in which assembled
literary men and learned doctors. Books were gathered by men who loved
them, and were in constant use by scholars and eager students. These
libraries were busy places. The librarians, frequently men noted for
their attainments in many fields, went out or sent others to gather rare
and precious books which, if necessary, were copied and translated into
Arabic. The position of librarian in Muslim lands during the medieval
ages must have been an honorable one, for in these four libraries, as in
others, it was often filled by great scholars, chosen apparently for
their knowledge of books. They were figures important in the society of
their times and often at court, members, rather than mere servants, of
the cultured and learned groups which gathered in the libraries (p.
281).
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The article is interesting, beautifully
written, and I'm learning a lot because much of the topic lies outside
my scope of knowledge.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> I like this passage:</p>
<blockquote>
Abd al Salām recalled an occasion when he was present at a class
conducted by a noted grammarian, Abu Saīd al Sirāfi. A student was
reading aloud from a philological work, and the master interrupted him
to dissertate on a fine point of grammar illustrated by a quoted poem.
Abd al Salām differed openly with the professor's explanation, thereby
humiliating Al Sirāfi's son who was present. He arose at once, returned
to his shop (he was a butter merchant), sold his business, and took to
study. He devoted himself exclusively to learning until he became a
scholar of the highest rank, and then composed a treatise in which he
explained the troublesome verses which had brought embarrassment to his
august father (pp. 291-292).
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Another nice remark (leaving out the anecdote,
which is delightful):</p>
<blockquote>
The somewhat trivial anecdote shows the concern of a librarian for the
books in his care, and also that librarians were not above playing the
sort of pranks one might rather expect from run boys (p. 293).
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Reflection:</strong> A few weeks ago I was telling someone
about this reading project of mine and I said that if I were able to
teach a library history doctoral seminar, I could see myself assigning
at least the first couple of volumes of <em>LQ</em> for reading. I think
that leads to an important argument for my thesis about the importance
of the journal as a whole unit as opposed to an isolated reading of
selected articles. I'll need to pursue this in my paper.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The author takes a jab:</p>
<blockquote>
Perhaps it is an early example of the type of school which seeks to
attract students by imposing buildings and modern equipment rather than
by high standards of scholarship (p. 298).

The Public Library in the Depression. <em>The Library Quarterly,
2</em>(4), 321-343. url:<a
href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/4301919">http://www.jstor.org/stable/4301919</a></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The first article of the fourth issue of the
second volume of <em>The Library Quarterly</em> is titled "The Public
Library in the Depression."</p>
<p>It was <em>prepared</em> by Douglas Waples, Leon Carnovsky, and
William M. Randall, who were affiliated with:</p>
<p><strong>Affiliation:</strong> University of Chicago</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> I use the word <em>prepared</em> above because
this article has no official author. Instead, the first footnote states
the following, as a footnote to the title of the article:</p>
<blockquote>
This article was prepared by Douglas Waples, Leon Carnovsky, and William
M. Randall from data collected by the <em>Library quarterly</em> (p.
321).
</blockquote>
<p>I feel, then, as if I'm violating something (perhaps a rule) by
explicitly placing Waples, Carnovsky, and Randall's names in the
reference above. It's as if the <em>Library Quarterly</em> itself is the
author of this piece (supposed corporate authorship?). However,
according to the <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/4301917">index</a>
for the volume, these three men are listed as the authors. Randall, it
should be noted, is the journal's managing editor.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Aside from the authorship issue, given the
topic of this article and the recent recession, this should make for a
really interesting piece.</p>
<p>To get started:</p>
<blockquote>
First, decreased revenues from taxation have resulted in smaller
appropriations for library purposes (p. 321).
</blockquote>
<p>Huh, sounds current.</p>
<blockquote>
The second respect in which the library has felt the effects of the
depression is in the increased service the library is called upon to
render (p. 322).
</blockquote>
<p>That also sounds current.</p>
<p>And then this:</p>
<blockquote>
We read that people out of work are spending more time either in reading
for recreation - to "kill time" - or in reading seriously, to learn the
fundamental economics involved in the depression or to acquire new
educational equipment in the hope of improving their chances for a new
job (p. 322).
</blockquote>
<p>And this, the reaction, sounds current:</p>
<blockquote>
Small wonder, then, that the leaders in the profession have raised the
cry against drastic reductions in library acquisitions, for seldom
before has the library stood out so sharply as a source of individual
hope and social amelioration (p. 322).
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> This is a good question / assumption to
highlight:</p>
<blockquote>
Theoretically, if library service is to remain constant, the library
appropriation should be actually increased (p. 325).
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Lots of relevant (to today) questions being
explored in this piece -- about collections, service, salaries,
buildings, and so on. I'll leave that out of these notes, but this is a
nice piece of wisdom, I think:</p>
<blockquote>
The foregoing data should interest the librarian in so far as he can
place his own institution in the general picture. But such orientation
demands a knowledge of local conditions affecting other libraries like
his own. Without such knowledge it does him little good to know whether
or not the other libraries are effecting the same economies. The fact
that other libraries of the same size and type are reducing the same
items of expense in the same proportion does not in itself show whether
his own budgeting is wise or unwise (p. 337).
</blockquote>
<p>The questions raised in the paragraph following the above passage are
brilliant.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> My goodness, this sounds like the ROI
literature of today:</p>
<blockquote>
Library officials will be forced, as never before in this country, to
rest their claims for appropriations, not upon sentimental appeals, but
upon the sort of evidence that city officials obtain from other
departments. Library development may easily receive a permanent setback
if, when called to account, the profession cannot demonstrate,
specifically and convincingly, the nature and scope of its service (p.
338).
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> This article continues to be brilliant.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> On not being trivial (this is also
brilliant):</p>
<blockquote>
Most librarians testify to large increases in economics, sociology,
political science, and history. But what are we to conclude? That the
muddle which politics has made of economics is driving men to John
Stuart Mill and his peers for consolation, that the reading is mostly
current history of the <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_A._Beard">Charles A.
Beard</a> type, or that the readers are at last taking the crisis
seriously enough to read forthright explanations of it in <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stuart_Chase">Stuart Chase</a>, <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_W._Laidler">Laidler</a> the
unfettered spokesman of the left (p. 341)?
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> This is fascinating (it immediately follows
the above paragraph:</p>
<blockquote>
The writer has checked a list of the better-known left-wing writers
against the catalogues of two city libraries and found them very poorly
represented. The problem of censorship involved here is incidentally a
matter of critical importance to public confidence in the library (p.
341).
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Reflection:</strong> This is simply one of the best articles
I've read. Waples, Carnovsky, and Randall deserve their status as
intellectual giants in library science.</p>

href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/4301920">http://www.jstor.org/stable/4301920</a></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The second article of the fourth issue of the
second volume of <em>The Library Quarterly</em> is titled "Observations
on Financing Libraries."</p>
<p>It was written by Simeon E. Leland, who was affiliated with:</p>
<p><strong>Affiliation:</strong> University of Chicago</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The second article on the Great Depression and
libraries.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> On valuating public services:</p>
<blockquote>
The first problem of government, therefore, is to evaluate collective
social wants and create means for sating them. The techniques employed
in making these valuations have to date been very crude, consisting
largely in the political appraisal of voters' demands rather than in the
scientific weighing of the social utilities of various governmental
services or combinations of functions (pp. 344-345).
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> More on the role of government (and an
indication of future dominance of cost / benefit analyses):</p>
<blockquote>
In such a set-up every institution supported by public funds can
reasonably be called upon to demonstrate its social utility, to prove
its capacity to render service on a least social cost basis, and to
demonstrate the extent of the benefits conferred upon the community (p.
345).
</blockquote>
<p>Leland then notes that the value of the public library, in terms of
its government support, should be weighed against the value of other
services and functions the government funds and supports, and this all
lies with the support of the taxpayers.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The Depression is influencing the important
questions (note the causal link between economic scarcity and questions
about essential services). Note also the attitude about recreation:</p>
<blockquote>
Is the library so vital a part of the educational system that its
facilities should be within reasonable reach of all of the inhabitants
of the country? Or is the function of the library essentially
recreational rather than educational, so that it should be classified
with the permissive functions of government rather than with activities
rendering essential public services (p. 347).
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Bottom of page 348, there's an important
discussion of library boards. Connect this section with the two articles
written by Joeckel on public libraries and governance <a
href="https://cseanburns.net/wiki/lq/volume-1-issue-2#article-1">Joeckel
1931a</a> and <a
href="https://cseanburns.net/wiki/lq/volume-1-issue-3#article-6">Joeckel
1931b</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> A discussion about government centralization
and how libraries should respond:</p>
<blockquote>
Many library boards, with their sovereign independence to hire and fire
irrespective of municipal civil service codes, and their independent tax
levies and self-controlled budgets and treasuries, will oppose this
general movement to simplify and improve the effectiveness of the
governmental machine. A large part of this opposition probably is based
upon the fear that the change will decrease the funds available for
library support. To hedge against this, the libraries should study their
financial problems, the methods for improving services, and the means
for reducing costs (p. 350).
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Then more on the reasons why librarians should
provide data that highlights their value. See page 351.</p>
<p>This discussion shows that the early drive to understand a library's
community arose out of a possible need to justify the existence of the
library as a tax funded institution. The input / output / outcome
literature surely stems from these early discussions. The questions at
the top of page 352 are still being asked.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> On the type of analysis:</p>
<blockquote>
This method of approaching the problem is designated as "unite cost
analysis." The cost accounting methods which are here involved have been
applied for many years to private undertakings, but only recently have
they been developed as aids in intelligent fiscal administration for
governmental bodies. So far as is known, the unit cost approach has not,
as yet, been applied to library work. The operations of the library,
however, can be readily adapted to this approach. Costs of library
circulation, reference service, cataloguing, indexing, and
bibliography-making can all be calculated on this basis (p. 353-354).
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> An important discussion about costs of
personnel and costs of collections takes place on pages 355-357. The
discussion is based on data. The following quote is from the first
sentence of the main paragraph on page 357 and highlights the importance
of the librarian as a professional (even if not stated as such) relative
to the material at hand in the library. The whole paragraph is highly
interesting:</p>
<blockquote>
These personal services may also have greater social utility than the
mere aggregation of reading matter and may be required to secure the
greatest usefulness from book collections (p. 357).
</blockquote>
<p>And then, more on the importance of the librarian (as I've stated
elsewhere, the librarian is what makes a library, otherwise a library is
simply a warehouse):</p>
<blockquote>
Such a concept of the library implies more than well-filled book shelves
with a clerk to dispense the volumes. It calls for adequate personnel to
carry the library to its patrons, to increase the velocity of book
circulation, to interest children in literature and to tell them
stories, to hunt up the sources of information on any subject, to
cross-index collections in order to maximize their usefulness, and to do
a score of things which trained librarians daily accomplish (p. 357).
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> I haven't commented on this yet, but there is
a lot of useful data in this early articles. For example, this article
cites library income per patron.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> This is somewhat funny, in a depressing sort
of way, because it hasn't really changed:</p>
<blockquote>
The folly of drawing political boundary lines within which governments
are to be locally supported with little or no relation to wealth or
taxable capacity is rapidly being recognized. Investigations of these
absurdities and inequalities in the field of library finance have not
been made, but the meager income available to many small libraries
reflects these conditions (p. 364).
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Ha, libraries have always had to apply methods
to limit the monopolizing of resources:</p>
<blockquote>
One library has even imposed a service charge for the use of city
directories and similar publications providing they are monopolized by
single readers for more than a stipulated maximum time (p. 366).
</blockquote>
<p>And after listing a variety of ways libraries can levy fees, this
important note:</p>
<blockquote>
Nevertheless, the revenue possibilities of such fees are probably very
limited (p. 366).
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Interesting note about the ultimate value of
the library (not in the hands of the librarians):</p>
<blockquote>
It remains for others to decide whether the claim of the library to a
portion of the public funds is equal to, or greater than, or even
inferior to, the claims of other departments and other public services.
This question as to what governments should do with their limited
resources is not for the librarians to determine, and in the long run
the decision will not be theirs (p. 366).
</blockquote>
<p>And thus begins the eighty year effort to argue for the value of the
library so that the public continues to support it:</p>
<blockquote>
They can help secure an answer favorable to themselves and to their
cause by studying the institution which they manage and by learning the
facts concerning their services and their fiscal operation (p. 366).

<p>More discussion about Goethe and what may be considered the problem
with the glut of information and managing that glut. There was early
interest in a union catalog, although that term is not used. Instead,
the German term "'Gesamt-Catalog'" is used and other phrases including
the "'Real-Catalog'" and the "'Nominal-Catalog'" (p. 369). Essentially,
the desire to unionize collections, either physically or indexically,
has existed for quite some time.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The number of social science articles in these
early volumes of *LQ* are interesting especially in comparison to the
number of historical / humanities articles.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Incredible story related by Goethe on pages
371-372.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The author summarizes Goethe's
accomplishments:</p>
<blockquote>
After two years of work, in December, 1819, Goethe was able to look back
with satisfaction on the work accomplished and report what he had done.
A veritable revolution had taken place. The several rooms that held the
library had been joined by doorways, partitions and screens had been
fixed, numerous repairs effected, and painting done; and, of course, a
wall had been razed and a garden improved, and a door had been cut into
a room once used by the medical faculty. In the library proper, an
accession book had been started, a new "Ausleihebuch" or loan-book had
been introduced, a name-catalogue on slips was in the making,
classification had been carried through the pure and applied sciences
and was progressing in other fields, and many other reforms were being
made. In November, 1824, after seven years of work, Goethe, at the age
of seventy-five, was able to report that his task had been completed (p.
373).
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Goethe's fascination with the loan-book. See
top of page 374.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Of course I've read Goethe, but I had no idea,
given these two articles on him, about his relationship and work with
libraries. Really quite fascinating. Needs more exploration.</p>

<p>It was written by Thomas M. Iiams, who was affiliated with:</p>
<p><strong>Affiliation:</strong> The Huntington Library</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The first page of the article contains a
photograph of a "vacuum fumigator" that was designed by the library.
Incredible photo. Kind of illustrates how self-sufficient libraries must
have been at the time.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> This is a particularly interesting comment
with regards to the future development and mission concerning special
collections:</p>
<blockquote>
The creation of "treasure rooms" in several large public and university
libraries during recent years shows a definite trend toward conservation
for posterity, making it clear that librarians in research institutions
are become definitely receptive to ideas other than those mainly
governing the purchase and circulation of books (p. 375).
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The article is about bookworms, or the
treatment of books that are plagued by bookworms. I did not expect
this.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> When the librarians at Huntington started
searching for a solution to the pest, they sometimes received this
humorous response:</p>
<blockquote>
Others reported that their libraries were free from all insect pests,
and seemed a bit surprised to learn that there was a bookworm other than
the human variety (p. 376).
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The bookworms (a kind of beetle) were a
serious problem (not just for the library but for the sake of preserving
knowledge). While the article is written with some humor at times, it
does also reflect the gravity the situation and what is at stake.
Consider:</p>
<blockquote>
Bear in mind, also, that in each case we had to satisfy ourselves that
there would be no deleterious effects on the materials fumigated, either
now or two centuries from now. This, of course, necessitated months of
research which would have been difficult without the very kind
co-operation of the California Institute of Technology (p. 381).

<p><strong>Note:</strong> The article does go beyond the issue of
bookworms and discusses climate and other atmospheric concerns,
including mold as well as air polution in industrial cities, related to
the long-term preservation of books. For example:</p>
<blockquote>
Our own investigation indicated that a temperature of 70 F. and a
relative humidity of 50 per cent, maintained day in and day out, are
ideal for the proper preservation of books and manuscripts. These
precise conditions we have been able to maintain for about two years.
Vellum manuscripts that curled and cracked when the humidity was low can
now be conveniently handled with assurance that gold illuminations will
not peel off (p. 385).

<p><strong>Note:</strong> The fifth article of the fourth issue of the
second volume of <em>The Library Quarterly</em> is titled "A
Bibliographical and Literary Study of the First Appearance of the
'Arabian Nights' in Europe."</p>
<p>It was written by Duncan B. Macdonald, who was affiliated with:</p>
<p><strong>Affiliation:</strong> Hartford, Connecticut (No
Affiliation)</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> I don't usually attempt to trace all the
authors who have no stated affiliation, but the following line sparked
by interest:</p>
<blockquote>
This, then, is an attempt to give an exact bibliographical description,
a <strong>visu</strong>, of the
original edition of Galland's <strong>Mille et une nuit</strong>, of
certain early reprints and translations of the same, and of some other
early editions of cognate books, all in my possession. The Galland
<strong>editio princeps</strong> is exceedingly rare; even the copy in
the Bibliothèque Nationale is incomplete; and no exact description of it
seems so far to have been made (pp. 387-388).
</blockquote>
<p>Specifically, that Macdonald would have possession of these works
made me think that he might be a rare book collector, and I thought it
interesting that an early contributor to <em>LQ</em> would be one among
this trade. A quick web search, though, shows that Macdonald was a
professor, retired just around the time of the publication of this
article. He has a inter-faith theological center named after him (if I
have truly traced the correct Macdonald): <a
href="http://www.hartsem.edu/macdonald/brief-history">The Duncan Black
Macdonald Center for the Study of Islam and Christian-Muslim
Relations</a>. The following is an article that discusses the person in
a little more detail (link in the above page): <a
href="http://www.hartsem.edu/sites/default/files/macdonald/articles/bijlefeldarticle.pdf">A
Century of Arabic and Islamic Studies at Hartford Seminary</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The article proceeds according to its title.
It includes rather detailed bibliographical descriptions of the volumes
of work that disseminated (first in France) the <em>Arabian Nights</em>
stories in France in the early 18th century. These descriptions also
include some background stories about the volumes.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> A new section titled "English Translation."
This interesting bit:</p>
<blockquote>
There seems to be no clue as to when the <strong>Nights</strong>
appeared first in English. Some unknown translator at a very early date
turned Galland's artistic French into the strangest Grub Street English.
Also he seems to have rendered from a La Haye edition.
</blockquote>
<p>I have not heard the term <em>Grub Street English</em>, but there's a
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grub_Street">Wikipedia page</a>
for it.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> I omit the detail, but this line says
something about the audience Macdonald hopes to reach by publishing in
<em>LQ</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
But the question belongs to the history of literature rather than to
bibliography (p. 412).

<p>Waples, Douglas. (1933). Community Studies in Reading: 1. Reading in
the Lower East Side. <em>The Library Quarterly, 3</em>(1), 1-20. url:<a
href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/4301940">http://www.jstor.org/stable/4301940</a></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The first article of the first issue of the
third volume of *The Library Quarterly* is titled "Community Studies in
Reading: 1. Reading in the Lower East Side."</p>
<p>It was written by Douglas Waples, who was affiliated with:</p>
<p><strong>Affiliation:</strong> University of Chicago</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The article begins with a description of brief
cultural and historical description of the community and explains why
this community is an important focus of study for reading habits:</p>
<blockquote>
To understand the distribution of reading matter, one must be able to
answer such questions as these: What proportion of the population are
readers? From what sources or agencies (such as newstands, rental
libraries, home libraries, settlement libraries, bookstores, pushcarts,
book clubs, reading-rooms, and public libraries) do the readers get
their reading? What kinds of reading matter and what proportion of each
kind does each occupational group obtain from each source (p. 2)?
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Waples then details how to collect data and
then asks the important question:</p>
<blockquote>
Granting the possibility of securing such facts, one may well ask what
they are worth. There are at least four plausible answers (p. 3).
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The first is to measure "social intelligence"
(p. 3). But here, he notes, it is not simply that a community reads but
that a community reads well-balanced material:</p>
<blockquote>
If the writing be sincere, competent, and multi-partisan, the more
widely it is read, the better for the whole community. Its consumption
by the general reader is a fair measure of social consciousness, of the
desire to meet critical issues rationally, and of unwillingness to evade
them. Hence the facts about community reading on current social problems
teach us much about man as a social animal. They help us to find out how
social he is: according to his occupation, age, schooling, race, and
habitat (p. 3).
</blockquote>
<p>Note the demographic characteristics he adds in the above
passage.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The second reason is to measure the value of
reading. Even then, librarians and library scholars were dealing with
alternate methods of communication, then it was radio, today it is the
Internet. In the paragraph after the one below, he also mentions as
sources of competition with reading: friends, motion pictures, museum
exhibits, lectures, and school courses (p. 4):</p>
<blockquote>
Secondly, the facts show what reading is actually worth in the given
community as a vehicle for ideas, and as compared with other arts of
communication. One sure thing is that critical reading in some American
communities is not provoked even by national disaster. The angels weep
when devout public librarians foist "good reading" upon a radio-minded
town (p. 3).
</blockquote>
<p>Thus:</p>
<blockquote>
Hence, before we take adult reading too seriously, it behooves us to
learn how successfully reading competes with the other arts of
communication (p. 4).
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> A third reason is to measure the comparison
between library reading and reading obtained from other sources. This
point is a matter of economy and of, according to Waples, libraries
being efficient agencies.</p>
<blockquote>
In the third place, and assuming that adult reading is sufficient in
amount and distribution to be an&gt; important source of ideas, we need
to know how library reading in the given community compares with reading
obtained from other sources, if only to avoid expensive duplication.
Given a picture of the total reading situation, where does library
reading fit in? To answer this question is the first step toward a
planned economy of public librarianship, that is, a program aimed at
results of cultural value to the whole community that are not
accomplished by other agencies (p. 4).
</blockquote>
<p>It's interesting that he writes this:</p>
<blockquote>
In times of economic collapse, these questions matter a great deal more,
particularly to the watchdogs of the city treasury. Hence, the urge
toward self-preservation, if not professional curiosity, should make
them interesting. Having mastered the essential problems of
administration and come to grips with the psychology of reading,
librarians now confront the mysteries of sociology. The present time is
ripe for a formulation of social policy, and we
</blockquote>
<p>lack the necessary facts (p. 4).</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> A fourth reason is to understand how to
provide the appropriate reading material. This is an historically
important reason:</p>
<blockquote>
A fourth reason for collecting the facts is that the more we know about
the sort of reading most acceptable to different population groups, the
better able we are to select <strong>good</strong> reading for the
library. We cannot say what <strong>is</strong> good reading until we
can answer the questions "good for whom?" and "good for what?" (p. 5).
</blockquote>
<p>Waples then criticizes the use of the Pulitzer award, but it would
seem that any such device as an indicator of good reading would be
sufficient for questioning, as a measure of what is good reading. Very
interesting argument.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Waples proceeds to discuss the neighborhood
under study. This bit on sexual material, just by nature of being in
this article, is fascinating:</p>
<blockquote>
There has been a perceptible decline in the sales of the sex
magazines---partly due to the competition of salacious books and partly
to the fact that sex magazines have not reduced their price; <strong>Gay
parisienne</strong>, <strong>La Paree</strong>, <strong>Paris
nights</strong>, <strong>Pep stories</strong>, <strong>Snappy
stories</strong>, <strong>Spicy stories</strong>, and <strong>Ten
story</strong> each sell for a quarter. These are obtainable only from
the stands, including the ten or twelve stationary shops that sell old
magazines for a very few cents, depending on how old they are (p. 7).
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Seems like book stores have always looked back
to some golden age (of course, the following passage could simply be
referring to times before the Depression):</p>
<blockquote>
Also, the proprietors know books. They impress one as good
people---courageous in their determination to believe that this unhappy
world will always contain readers of good books, yet wistful of the old
days whenever the talk turns upon sales (p. 9).
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> This is a really provoking description of a
book store:</p>
<blockquote>
The famous shop of Maisel on Grand street deserves a book of its own.
One rarely meets an individual more competent than the proprietor to
select the sort of books that everyone should read; nor does one often
feel the seductive fascination of books so strongly as when poking
around his shelves. Forty-five years at the same address, a warm
interest in people as such, and an instinct for the well-written book in
any tongue and on any theme, have produced a literary shrine of unusual
richness. It feels a holy place (p. 9).
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The next passage relates an interview, with
quotes, with someone who sells books by a pushcart.</p>
<p>And then Waples, with or without explicit intention, makes a case for
qualitative methodology:</p>
<blockquote>
Such people are mentioned with no interest of substituting sentiment for
figures. They demonstrate the presence of thoroughly good people in the
local book trades--nearly prostrate though the business is. Such people
make for a qualitative influence of reading which numbers do not catch
(p. 10).
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Next Waples begins to focus on the public
library. He first describes the role of occupation and the kind of
information the occupation variable can contain.</p>
<blockquote>
Occupation is the central fact in the lives of most Americans. Hence in
comparing populations of any sort, it is convenient to compare the
proportions engaged in different kinds of work. Occupation is perhaps
the best single label, because it usually implies significant
differences in schooling, intelligence, and economic status, and often
implies differences in cultural status and age (p. 11).
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Interesting observation about the relationship
between sex and reading (see page 12). Waples finds, surprisingly for
him, that sex does not predict the amount of reading (both sexes read
about the same amount) but it is able to say something about what is
read.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> This is kind of funny. On page 13, Waples
lists a number of reasons that affect library use. The list includes
items that are still valid today, but this one is striking and telling
of the times:</p>
<blockquote>
Among the conditions which obviously affect popular use of the library
are ... the inability to smoke (which should bother some women as much
as it bothers some men) ... (p. 13).
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> I've left out a lot of details of this study,
but I should note that the questions asked and the data presented is as
sophisticated and as meaningful as anything done today.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The conclusion of the article is poignant.</p>
<blockquote>
The wealth and variety of writing that records the spiritual and
intellectual adventures of all manner of men in all countries during all
these vicissitudes is available for our own guidance today. It stands
ready to explain what any one of us has enough curiosity to learn
regarding the chances for Western civilization to survive. Such reading
is as valuable an experience for any rational person as modern society
has to offer (p. 20).

<p><strong>Note:</strong> The second article of the first issue of the
third volume of <em>The Library Quarterly</em> is titled "Some
Implications in the New Plan of the University of Chicago for College
Libraries."</p>
<p>It was written by Augustus Frederick Kuhlman, who was affiliated
with:</p>
<p><strong>Affiliation:</strong> University of Chicago Libraries</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The article discusses the impact or
implications resulting from changes that the University of Chicago
President Robert Maynard had overseen (the *New Plan*). I've read about
this before, but I can't recall which work it was. Will have to
investigate later.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The author then discusses how the library will
support the New Plan. He discusses the new courses and the specific ways
the library will support these courses. Very detailed.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Nice observation:</p>
<blockquote>
Third, in this new curriculum and as part of the teaching method and
content, books hold a position of major importance. But not just books,
not even titles in a standard list, are called for. As was just pointed
out, quality of titles, and specific titles for a specific purpose, is
what counts. Once a college abolishes course credits and grades as a
basis for granting a degree and tries to set up genuine and tested
educational attainments as the prerequisite, the great problem becomes:
How can the best that the human spirit has achieved be made available to
the student? (p. 33).
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> I'll have to search for where I read about
Robert Maynard Hutchins and his work at the University of Chicago. It's

href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/4301942">http://www.jstor.org/stable/4301942</a></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The third article of the first issue of the
third volume of <em>The Library Quarterly</em> is titled "The Dormitory
Library: An Experiment in Stimulating Reading."</p>
<p>It was written by Leon Carnovsky, who was affiliated with:</p>
<p><strong>Affiliation:</strong> University of Chicago</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The University of Chicago, in the 1931-32,
opened a new dorm that offers new amenities to its students. Carnovsky
seeks to understand how the new dorm, which has "two library rooms, one
at either end of the building" (p. 37), influences reading.</p>
<p>The rooms (libraries) have ash-trays, a noted convenience.
Interesting.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The article does not (yet) make specific
mention of the <a
href="https://cseanburns.net/wiki/lq/volume-3-issue-1#article-2">previous
article</a> that covered the University of Chicago's new educational
plan, but it does discuss the new dorm with respect to that plan.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The Graduate Library School maintains the
dormitory libraries. This is on purpose -- as the School intentionally
desired to maintain these dormitory libraries in order to study and
learn,</p>
<blockquote>
something about reading habits, motives, incentives--in short, about
reading behavior" (p. 40)
</blockquote>
<p>of these students.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Carnovsky mentions Kuhlman's article in the
third footnote.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Carnovsky and the School kept two records. A
book record recorded titles in circulation. The other record:</p>
<blockquote>
The reader record was something of an innovation. It consisted of a card
for each student upon which the titles withdrawn by any student were at
once written (p. 41).
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Carnovsky discusses various limitations of the
study. See bottom of page 41.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Based on Table II (p. 42), it appears students
charged books much less frequently toward the end of the year than they
do at the beginning. Reference books in circulation are not included in
the figures.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> More limitations discussed on pages 42-43.
Many of these limitations are normal limitations based on the kind of
data that is based on circulation records. For example, such records
cannot indicate the reading of a book in the library (i.e., one not
checked out).</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Carnovsky confirms on page 44 that,</p>
<blockquote>
library withdrawals decreased steadily from quarter to quarter (p. 44).
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Carnovsky discusses the reading habits of the
optional books by General Course category. I may not have noted in this
in my Kuhlman notes, but the University of Chicago's new educational
plan included four areas of educational emphasis:</p>
<ul>
<li>Humanities</li>
<li>Social Sciences</li>
<li>Biological Sciences</li>
<li>Physical Sciences</li>
</ul>
<p>Based on Carnovsky's study, the distribution of reading is very
positively skewed, as it is in most such distributions, e.g., Bradford.
Carnovsky makes this conclusion:</p>
<blockquote>
Even granting that some reading has taken place of which we have no
record, it seems safe to conclude that the amount of reading done is
disappointing. In the case of each course, were it not for a few
individuals who have read somewhat extensively, the average number of
books borrowed would be altogether negligible (p. 49).
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Carnovsky notes that while reading course
related material may not have been substantial, the presence of books
outside the scope of the courses (a "general collection of books" p. 50)
may have been substantial. That is, the dormitory libraries may have
influenced reading, just not reading for coursework. He refers to this
as "independent reading" (p. 50). In light of this scenario, Carnovsky
asks the following two research questions:</p>
<blockquote>
1. Are the heavy readers of optional books also heavy readers of
independent material; and conversely, are the light readers of the
optional also light readers of the independent? Or, more directly in
line with the proposed hypothesis, are the heavy users of independent
reading matter among the light readers of the optional (p. 50)?
</blockquote>
<p>And:</p>
<blockquote>
2. What is the relationship between types of material read and
scholarship? Are the heavy readers of independent materials good or poor
students; and are the non-library users necessarily poor students (p.
51).
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Even though it's a minor sentence in the
whole, Carnovsky makes an important conceptual distinction here:</p>
<blockquote>
Group two, on the other hand, contained the readers, or better, the
library users (p. 52).
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> In general, Carnovsky finds, after analyzing
optional and independent reading, that there are a significant number of
non-readers in this total group of students.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Regarding the second question above, some
interesting findings:</p>
<blockquote>
From the data presented it would appear that the more optional reading
one does, the better one's chances for creditably passing the four
general courses. This is exactly what would be expected, but it is
possible to go farther. For example, the contrary does not necessarily
follow: namely, that little or no optional reading is necessarily
associated with poor grades (p. 54).
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> This is not a controlled study and there are a
number of errors related to sampling, mostly, but also the lack of good
statistical tests at the time, that leave me doubtful of the conclusions
here. But Carnovsky is aware of this limitation:</p>
<blockquote>
Even remembering the qualification that one year's experience with a
small sample is too limited to justify generalizations ... (p. 55).
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The next few pages discuss the reading habits
of sophomores, juniors, and seniors. In short, they read more. Carnovsky
discusses a few reasons why this may be the case, which I'll leave out
here, and suggests some future studies that will help explore the
issue.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> On to the reading habits of graduate
students.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Nice conclusion. Ties together the work done
by librarians and the work done by instructors with the collective aim
to pursue the University's new educational plan. Faults or no, the
implementation of the educational plan really does seem like it was a
collective effort.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Interesting, from a historical perspective,
note about the use of circulation statistics as a research
instrument:</p>
<blockquote>
Finally, the study is perhaps worth undertaking as a demonstration of
how circulation statistics may be used not only to measure the effects
of instruction but also to study the similarities and differences in the
reading of college students (p. 31).

Third, librarians going into school libraries experience greatest
difficulties in problems which involve the dealing with personalities.
The school library supervisors agree that this is true. In this case,
again, about half of the persons reporting lack of adequate training
state that library science courses could help prepare for that
situation. Many comments were made to the effect that only tact,

<p><strong>Note:</strong> The fifth article of the first issue of the
third volume of <em>The Library Quarterly</em> is titled "Student use of
the library."</p>
<p>It was written by Alvin C. Eurich, who was affiliated with:</p>
<p><strong>Affiliation:</strong> University of Minnesota</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> A nice early study of library use. Most
students, for example, during the study period checked out books in the
following areas: literature (primarily English / British), history,
education, economics, philosophy, and sociology. Etc. There is some
disagreement between the surrounding text and the accompanying figure on
page 88. In the surrounding text, the author refers to the fourth
ranking item as philosophy but in the accompanying chart, it's referred
to as philology and it's ranked fifth. This is because the paragraph
doesn't include Education, which in the chart is ranked third. This is
all from the general circulation.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The author then describes the use and
circulation of reserve books. The question the author is interested in,
partly at least, is whether the books on reserve are serving their
purpose. Seems so:</p>
<blockquote>
In other words, the circulation of books follows closely the number of
books in each field that are placed on reserver (p. 92).
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Next periodicals.</p>
<p>Whoops:</p>
<blockquote>
A misunderstanding caused the call-slips to be destroyed for the first
day of the period of observation (p. 92).
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> On to student use of the library by ratio. The
author goes to lengths to stress the difference between the ratio and
the proportion of use.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> This is an extremely interesting comment that
just comes kind of as an accident but is revealing of the times and the
university movement in general:</p>
<blockquote>
If the new freedom that college students are being given is to develop
greater initiative in the realm of scholarship, an increased use of the
library should become evident (p. 94).

<p><strong>Note:</strong> The first article of the second issue of the
third volume of <em>The Library Quarterly</em> is titled "The Service of
Libraries in Promoting Scholarship and Research."</p>
<p>It was written by Louis R. Wilson, who was affiliated with:</p>
<p><strong>Affiliation:</strong> University of Chicago</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Article begins with a description of two new
libraries "devoted exclusively to the purposes of scholarship and
research" (p. 127). The section concludes with a description of the
article's purpose:</p>
<blockquote>
Let us consider briefly, and largely by means of illustration, five
types of service which American libraries are effectively rendering the
scholar today. They are: (1) the accumulation of materials; (2) making
materials available; (3) personal assistance to scholars; (4) directing
research and publication; and (5) aiding scholarship through
international co-operation (p. 128).
</blockquote>
<p>This is a timely discussion.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The next seven pages document the efforts many
university and special libraries have made in order to build collections
in the first part of the 20th century. This section contains valuable
historical information and includes a discussion, among other things, of
various cooperative efforts.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The next section, on "making materials
available," begins with a discussion of library buildings and the use of
them for reading. Then comes a segment on libraries providing catalogs
to its users. This includes,</p>
<blockquote>
the development of a complete dictionary catalogue of its holdings, with
duplicate catalogues for departmental libraries, indexes of periodicals
and proceedings of learned societies, printed catalogues of othe notable
libraries, and bibliographical and critical apparatus concerning all the
subjects contained in the holdings of the library (p. 136).
</blockquote>
<p>Even as early as 1933, television (as an electronic information
technology) was considered a possible tool for libraries. See last
paragraph of last section on p. 138.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The next section is on "personal assistance to
scholars." Here's a key point:</p>
<blockquote>
In most libraries emphasis has very naturally been placed on the
acquisition of materials and their preparation for use. Too seldom has
it been placed on assistance in use. But this is changing (p. 139).
</blockquote>
<p>Wilson proceeds to document the many ways that librarians are doing
expert work in the services they provide to scholars. Many of these
services are still done today although some may look a little different
given changes in various technologies.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The next section is on "directing research and
publication." The discussion focuses on librarians as scholars amidst
scholars. That is, the focus is not only on librarians as scholars, but
it is also on the unique position librarians have as scholars because
they are not tied to any specific department but are institutionally
oriented.</p>
<p>I like this line on the importance of bibliography:</p>
<blockquote>
His service to bibliography, the starting-point and foundation of all
sound investigation, has been of inestimable value as he has given it
precision and form (p. 142).
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The next section is on "aiding scholarship
through international co-operation." Discusses the beginnings of IFLA.
More generally, it discusses the kinds of activities librarians among
various nations have worked together exchange documents and help build
each others libraries.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Wilson finally asks the following
question:</p>
<blockquote>
What have libraries done, and what are they doing to kindle the
enthusiasms of youth and to make men scholars (p. 144).
</blockquote>
<p>He draws from a letter written by a former student and then he writes
this really eloquent bit:</p>
<blockquote>
His letter stopped here, but I can imagine something further. One day,
while at work with rare books or early manuscripts, or in conference
with his instructor in the library, a new spirit stirred within him. The
passing of graduate courses, as such, ceased to be a goal. Knowledge of
the civilization of which the books or manuscripts were evidences became
a passion ... (p. 144).
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Wilson ends by stating that while he doesn't
know the magnitude of the effect that libraries have produced in their
aid to scholars, he does believe that libraries are a necessary
condition for scholarship.</p>
<p>Really nice piece.</p>

<p>It was written by A. Kaiming Chiu, who was affiliated with:</p>
<p><strong>Affiliation:</strong> Harvard University</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> As the title indicates, this article is about
the national libraries in China. There were three of them at the time,
and all were open to the public. This should be a really interesting
article. Chiu will discuss their history, their collections, and how the
collections are organized.</p>
<p><strong>Reflection:</strong> Just a side thought. Since I know very
little about Chinese libraries, this article may or may not impact me as
much as, for example, previous articles on topics I'm very close to have
(e.g., articles on library school education, etc.). So it may be, as it
has been with other articles that are outside my experience, that I may
post very little in this entry. I need to examine which of my posts are
the longest. That should say something about which articles have meant
the most to me. But also look at which posts are the shortest --
identify my areas of weakness or areas that may be of interest at a
later time.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Some interesting stuff on classification in
here. Not a whole lot though (yet).</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Discussion of readership, circulation,
catalogs, reference works such as gazetteers, encyclopedias, rare works,
printing, stone tablets, maps, paintings, manuscripts.</p>
<p>Regarding The National Library of Peiping, too bad:</p>
<blockquote>
The library seems unwilling to make known its classification system
until it has perfected it (p. 160).
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> On page 167, an interesting description of the
rules that resident research scholars had to follow at The National
Sinological Library of Nanking.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Alfred Kaiming Chiu was an interesting person.

<p>It was written by Ernest J. Reece, who was affiliated with:</p>
<p><strong>Affiliation:</strong> Columbia University</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> This is not an exceptionally profound article,
but it does require some reflection. Also, this is Reece's fourth
article in *LQ*, and each article is on some aspect of library
education. The first three articles by Reece:</p>
<ol>

</ol>
<p>Here's the most important question that Reece raises, and there are
parts of it that I find problematic:</p>
<blockquote>
How best to supplement theoretical instruction with work-contacts has
been the subject of much controversy in professional circles generally,
and latterly among librarians. Probably most of this disputation, at
least in the case of librarians, has been quite needless. All concerned
hold that work-contacts and work-participation are antecedent to
competence, and that therefore they constitute an indispensable element
in professional participation. On the other hand, most doubtlessly would
agree that the services of schools in imparting certain knowledge,
attitudes, and skills are of value if only in the reducing of
apprenticeship and in the consequent saving of time to the intending
practitioner (p. 171).
</blockquote>
<p>It's that last sentence that is most troubling and yet, most
interesting.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> The first article of the third issue of the

<p>It was written by August Frederick Kuhlman, who was affiliated
with:</p>
<p><strong>Affiliation:</strong> University of Chicago Libraries</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Begins with a great description (definition)
of research libraries.</p>
<blockquote>
The objectives of a research library may be said to be twofold. From one
point of view, it is an end in itself. Its object as a depository is to
acquire, organize, and preserve <strong>all</strong> of the material of
merit within those fields of human knowledge and activity that fall
within its defined scope. The aim is to be a treasure house which in its
acquisitions has kept abreast of the progress of those sciences with
which it is concerned, or has even anticipated coming trends. It stands
ready to offer the scholar unexplored materials with which he can make
new discoveries and extend the bounds of knowledge. From another point
of view, however, the research library is a means and not an end. Its
function is one of mediation between the scholar's research goals and
the sources that must be discovered, acquired, and placed at his
disposal under favorable working conditions if he is to be effective. To
serve either of these functions well, particularly the latter,
presupposes active teamwork between scholars and librarians, for the
building of collections represents the product of constantly integrating
sources that are to be acquired and preserved with the changing and
evolving research objectives and goals of scholars (p. 229).
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Reflection:</strong> I read those words above and I feel as
if they are now fighting words. Those words are inspiring. And I want to
talk with people about them.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The rest of the paragraph highlights the
important relationship between librarians and scholars in the pursuit of
social science research.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> This is an important article. Details the
history of the Social Science Research Council, discusses some of the
important work in developing collections that would enhance social
science research, and this includes important reference works such as
<em>Social Science Abstracts</em>, and highlights the important role
that librarians had in advancing social scientific research.</p>

<blockquote>
Those who attended the 1932 Annual Conference of the Library
Association, held at Bournemouth under the presidency of Sir Henry
Miers, could not fail to be impressed by the fact that the attendance
was practically normal, and that, <strong>with due allowance for the
inevitable percentage of "web blankets," the spirit of the profession as
a whole remained undaunted</strong> [emphasis added] (p. 250).

<p><strong>Note:</strong> The third article of the third issue of the

applicants to a library school or training class: An approach to a
technique."</p>
<p>It was written by Charles K. A. Wang, who was affiliated with:</p>
<p><strong>Affiliation:</strong> Kaifeng, China (No Affiliation)</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The study reported in this article is based on
personnel records. This could be interesting. Given the reported
location of the author, it's not yet clear if the library system he
refers to is one that is located in the U.S. or in China.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> I believe this is the first article that most
closely resembles the modern structure of a "scientific" article. It has
a "procedure" section, a "results" section, and a "discussion
section."</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The amount of information libraries had on
their personnel is staggering:</p>
<blockquote>
On the other hand, the library does have personnel records covering the
graduates in its training class. Such records are of varying
completeness and include application blanks, entrance-examination
scores, library-training records, and intelligence scores (p. 253).
</blockquote>
<p>And:</p>
<blockquote>
Up to the present, selection has been based in part on entrance
examinations, school records, and, more recently, intelligence scores;
but the number of qualified applicants so far exceeds vacancies in the
training class that selection has rested largely on the subjective
opinions of a few interviewers. This study undertakes to evaluate
certain personality factors which by their presence or absence may
contribute to one's success as a library assistant (p. 254).
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> In the procedure section, the author uses
personnel records but also questionnaires. Plus! Two personality tests.
One that measures introversion and extroversion and the other, which the
author developed, that measures "persistence." Plus!! An efficiency
rating was devised --- to measure how efficient a person was at books or
with people, and so could be placed in the appropriate position. This is
incredible.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Interesting correlations throughout.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Although it's not labeled, there's essentially
a section that discusses limitations. See the middle paragraph on page
262.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> His suggestions:</p>
<blockquote>
When these tests are given, the test scores are of selective value in
themselves aside from the part they contribute to the total efficiency
scores. In the case of the entrance examinations now in use, it is
suggested that candidates be eliminated if their score is under 55. In
the case of the intelligence test, candidates with scores of under 100
may be removed from further consideration. On the test of
introversion-extroversion, it is probably safe to eliminate the extreme
introverts, i.e., those with a score of +20 or more. With regard to the
persistence scale, there is probably little to lose in eliminating
candidates with a score below 60 (p. 263).
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Wow, the importance of being "objective":</p>
<blockquote>
If, however, they are supplemented by intelligent observation on the
part of the interviewer, such occasional errors might be avoided,
although this subjective judgment is by no means encouraged (p. 263).

<p><strong>Note:</strong> The fourth article of the third issue of the
third volume of <em>The Library Quarterly</em> is titled "Graduate
theses accepted by library schools in the United States from June, 1928,
to June, 1932."</p>
<p>It was written by Douglas Waples, who was affiliated with:</p>
<p><strong>Affiliation:</strong> University of Chicago</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> In an examination of Master's theses coming
out of library schools, Waples asks:</p>
<blockquote>
What is the field of librarianship as defined by the 148 theses
reported?
</blockquote>
<p>The question reminded me of a more <a
href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1086/662945">current LQ
article</a>, which I thought might cite Waples, but doesn't.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The paragraph below captures what this entire
enterprise is about: what is the one, necessary purpose of the
library?</p>
<blockquote>
There is no question, of course, but that libraries will endure, as they
always have endured, if only for the purpose of preserving records that
each age considers important---witness the pyramids of Gizeh. But now
the question of most immediate importance is how many and which of the
other recreational and educational values to contemporary society, as
urged by the American public library in justification for generous
public support, can be made convincing to the present taxpayers and city
councils (p. 268).
</blockquote>
<p>Waples assumes it's preserving records, and he assumes that for good
reason. But now that records are increasingly decentralized, the
question is whether that will remain a continuing assumption. Perhaps it
is "the other recreational and educational values" that will become the
necessary purpose of the library. This is part of the modern question,
it seems to me.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> As a reminder, this article was published
amidst the Great Depression. One concern that Waples is addressing
concerns the relevancy of libraries in such times.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Here is one instance where the early library
scientists defined one of the fundamental questions of the field:</p>
<blockquote>
To attack the problems directly may require some change in professional
attitudes toward the reading needs of the community. For example, some
studies may best proceed from the assumption that the economic situation
requires the public library, by analogy with the tax-supported schools,
to identify those now receiving its benefits in order to make plain that
it reaches a sufficiently large and diversified part of the population
to justify public support; to show that certain benefits of reading are
not so readily obtained from other distributing agencies; and to specify
the scope of benefits peculiar to library services. From this point of
departure, <strong>the definition of the library's social benefits is a
task to which some students of librarianship should devote their full
energies.</strong> The problems which need to be studied from this point
of view have consequently suggested our headings [emphasis added] (pp.
269-270).
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Table 1 on page 271 lists the theses subjects.
In my study of the history of library science, I need to find and read
these.</p>
<p>Waples asks:</p>
<blockquote>
"What is the field of librarianship as defined by the theses?" (p. 271).
</blockquote>
<p>Here's the paragraph that outlines the theses:</p>
<blockquote>
The field of librarianship as defined by the titles in general terms in
Table 1. The headings for the three of the classes are ambiguous,
namely, "Description of current library practices," "Library
organization," and "All others." The forty-one theses classed as
description of current practice are subdivided as follows: twelve on
cataloguing and classification, nine on book selection, eight on
educational activities, five on library extension, two on interlibrary
lending, two on lending and circulation, and three on general practices.
Library organization, with the exclusion of historical and survey
treatments, is represented by eleven theses---two on legislation, four
on finance, two on buildings, and three on holdings. "All others"
include seventeen theses: seven in the field of reading, three on
publishing, four on criteria for library services, and three on sources
and methods of research (pp. 271-272).
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Waples compares these theses with non-library
PhD dissertations that are about libraries in some way and that were
published in 1930. It's not entirely clear what areas or fields have
launched these dissertations, but Waples provides a way to track them
down.</p>

<p>It was written by Clara W. Herbert, who was affiliated with:</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> Another article relating to personnel and to
standards (see also <a

3</a> from this issue).</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Interesting quote from George Washington about
having too many students per instructor. See page 293.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> There is a very real desire to make the
evaluation of library work as non-subjective as possible. The desire for
objectivity is, it should be noted, a desire for fairness. This article,
for example, at least begins in search of some mathematical way to
determine how many circulation personnel are needed at any given library
in order to maximize the benefit these services offer to the community
and to minimize the cost to the taxpayers.</p>
<p>For example (and I can't get over this paragraph):</p>
<blockquote>
Perhaps the following explanation will make Table I clearer. It will be
noted that the unit of measurement was based on the smallest agency; for
example under administration, if the square footage of the D branch is
2,211, the units for A, B, C branches will be there square footage
divided by 2,211 or 3.4, 3.6, and 6.1, respectively. Again, if one unit
is assigned to a staff of 4 persons, the units for a staff of 7 will be
as many as 4 will go into 7 or 1.7; a staff of 12 will be as many as 4
goes into 12 or 3.0; and a staff of 22 will be as many as 4 goes into 22
or 5.5. This procedure is followed throughout the table to give a
picture of the relative demands of branches of different types. In
translating the total units into time required, however, the standard of
comparison was shifted to the B or Southeastern Branch because of its
more typical aspects. All comparisons could have been made on the
Southeastern Branch, but to avoid the use of decimals it was thought
more convenient to compare the activities on the basis of the smallest
branch. To complete the explanation: If the sum of the units
representing the activities under "Administration" is 13.6 at the
Southeastern Branch and it takes thirty-two hours weekly to perform
them, it will take as many at the Mount Pleasant Branch as
13.6:32::23.6:x, or 56 hours (p. 296).
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Reflection:</strong> Now refer to Kuhn and his discussion of
paradigms and rules. As much as Kuhn's discussion of these topics
applies to the social sciences, generally, and to library science,
specifically (and that's doubtful), there is something to be said in
that while we may maintain the same paradigms as these 1930 library
researchers, our rules for expressing and rationalizing these paradigms
are much different today. In short, the paragraph above is not the kind
of paragraph, I think, we'd see in present day literature.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> This article also follows the standard
structure (<em>LQ</em> articles are evolving): It's outline:</p>
<ul>
<li>Objectives (includes a literature review, so to speak)</li>
<li>Procedure</li>
<li>Results</li>
</ul>
<p>Also has various subsections.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The "factory" statement is good because I was
thinking that's what the author was trying to do:</p>
<blockquote>
<strong>Standards of achievement</strong>.---Third, we wish to set up
standards of achievement. We have no desire to turn the library into a
factory or to place upon the staff strain additional to that inherent in
public service. We felt, however, that reasonable standards based on
figures of day-in and day-out work, not those obtained under the
pressure of making a record, would be a satisfaction to the assistant
and give us a sound position before economy boards. Accordingly, the
following standards are before us tentatively. After experimentation
they may require further revision (p. 302).
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Reflection:</strong> Interestingly, this is the exact kind of
thing I desired to know when I was a cataloger. I wanted some idea of
how many books I was supposed to process per hour.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Just wondering what kind of mechanical devices
the author refers to:</p>
<blockquote>
we are using forms and mechanical devices whenever possible ... (p.
303).

<p>Shera, J. H. (1933). Recent Social Trends and Future Library Policy.
<em>The Library Quarterly, 3</em>(4), 339-353. url:<a
href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/4302010">http://www.jstor.org/stable/4302010</a></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The first article of the fourth issue of the
third volume of <em>The Library Quarterly</em> is titled "Recent Social
Trends and Future Library Policy."</p>
<p>It was written by J. H. Shera, who was affiliated with:</p>
<p><strong>Affiliation:</strong> Miami University</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Enter Shera.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> This piece begins with a scolding (Shera was
good at this) of those librarians who fail to see "the need for a
sociological concept of the library profession" (p. 339).</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Shera discusses Borden's work (see <a
href="https://cseanburns.net/wiki/lq/volume-1-issue-3#article-3">my
notes on the piece by Borden</a>).</p>
<blockquote>
Any adequate interpretation of future library policy must necessarily,
therefore, be based on a thorough recognition of <strong>the library as
the product of social and economic forces</strong> that have been
evolving during the past three-quarters of a century. Mr. Borden, in the
paper previously cited, has admirably paved the way for these new
concepts [emphasis added] (p. 340).
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> It's weird reading this because it's so
current:</p>
<blockquote>
Suffice it here to state that the downward trend of the birth-rate and
the extension of the expectation of life and resulting aging of our
population cannot but affect materially the type of public that
librarians of the future will serve. The census of 1930 showed
unmistakably that our period of rapid growth in numbers is definitely at
an end. With the older people constituting an increasingly larger
percentage of our population, the demand for leisure-time activities and
the services of the librarian should increase, while the children's
librarians, relieved of the burden of ever increasing numbers to serve,
can shift their attention from quantity to quality (pp. 341-342).
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> I'm often interested in what people and
sources these early <em>LQ</em> authors cite. It would be interesting to
study that.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Interesting discussion of decentralization.
See p. 345.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Writing about how libraries can serve various
aesthetic functions, "make beauty increasingly a vital part of our
lives" (p. 349), Shera writes for a fluid definition / conception of the
library:</p>
<blockquote>
There will be many who will argue that all this is without the province
of the library---that a library is not a museum---that such confusion of
purpose strikes at the very heart of the library's true function. In the
cities, with large art collections and great museums just around the
corner, such a rigid interpretation of the function of the library may
be well and good. But in the increasingly important village the library
must broaden its scope and become a true cultural center (p. 349).
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> How like the 1930s to the present.</p>
<p>The Depression and its effects:</p>
<blockquote>
The profession is confronted by the first serious crisis in its short
history. Ever since the publication, over a year ago, of Mr. Joeckel's
important study of supply and demand in the library field, librarians
have long known of the ravages of unemployment in their ranks; and much
has been written about it but little has been done (p. 350).
</blockquote>
<p>Shera is referring to a piece Joeckel published in <em>Library
Journal</em>, but Joeckel has also published articles in <em>LQ</em>
(search wiki for more by Joeckel).</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Again, scathing. Shera continues from
above:</p>
<blockquote>
It is needless to point out the inevitable consequences and economic
folly of this short-sighted policy. Suffice it to say that if a service
is worth rendering, it merits compensation, and if librarians persist in
the sanction of such practices they can anticipate little relief from
their present ills (p. 350).
</blockquote>
<p>And now he scolds library schools (just continuing from previous
sentence):</p>
<blockquote>
Yet, in the face of all this, the library schools are not cooperating as
they should. Even the chairman of the Junior Members Round Table of the
A.L.A. is compelled to admit that "While some schools are radically
reducing enrollment, others are merely making a gesture." This is not
time to allow personal institutional pride to work against the best
interests of the profession. There must be a "domestic allotment plan"
for the library schools (pp. 350-351).
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Could see it coming. He proposes a central
planning commission that would have a great deal of authority of all
libraries in the U.S.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Reading Shera is always interesting. Usually
brilliant. I must admit, though, that I can almost hear a <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palpatine">Palpatine</a> laugh when I
read this line:</p>
<blockquote>
This does not mean that local libraries will have to surrender much of
their present autonomy. As a matter of fact they will be virtually as
independent as they now are. <strong>Only as their individual policies
might work at cross-purposes with the master-plan will they feel the
presence of any restraint or authority</strong> [emphasis added] (pp.
351-352).
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Sometimes I think that Shera is way too quick
on the draw, and I disagree with some of his arguments in this article,
but I do think this is true:</p>
<blockquote>
Librarians must create vision and venturesome leadership or the
profession will suffer. They must take their calling more seriously,
define their functions more closely, engage in more searching
self-criticism, in more radical professional thought; ... (p. 353).

<p><strong>Note:</strong> This is the first article that I've only
skimmed and not read thoroughly. The reason is that it is an annotated

reference works related to anonyms and pseudonyms. As the author
states:</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> Historical note:</p>
<blockquote>
Whereas almost every state has some provision in its constitution for
the establishment and maintenance of the public school, only one state,
Michigan, provides in any way at all for the public library (p. 373).
</blockquote>
<p>More:</p>
<blockquote>
Notwithstanding this, the establishment and support of the public
library is still considered to be a local function, and not an
obligation of the state. This is quite evident from the legislative
enactments. In no case is library legislation compulsory as is school
legislation (p. 375).
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Good article for anyone interested in public
library funding --- especially the history of it.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> There is a lot of good and detailed
information in this article, but here's one of the author's main
points:</p>
<blockquote>
As has been indicated above, the most significant difference between
school legislation and library legislation is that the one is compulsory
and the other permissive, though the general property tax is the main
source of revenue for both these services (p. 386).
</blockquote>
<p>More:</p>
<blockquote>
The library receives little state aid because it is still conceived of
as a local function (p. 386).
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Another historical note / observation:</p>
<blockquote>
The county library system as developed in California and other states is
a serious attempt to avoid wastefulness and duplication in basic library
collections, buildings, equipment, catalogues, et al., in communities
which are sufficiently close to one another to receive library service
from a common source. It would, however, be premature and perhaps
inaccurate to infer that the county is the ideal unit for purposes of
library organization (p. 387).
</blockquote>
<p>The rest of the paragraph contains important points about determining
library unit sizes, scopes, reach, etc. based on empirical data rather
than on politic divisions.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> So, like <a
href="https://cseanburns.net/wiki/lq/volume-3-issue-4#article-1">Shera</a>,
the author makes note of the increasing centralization of government.
This would have been on the public's mind at the time (given President
Roosevelt's efforts at the time to combat the Depression):</p>
<blockquote>
The problem of determining the proper unit for library organization and
support is bound up with the larger problem of governmental
consolidation and centralization. The movement toward consolidation is
close at hand, and it is a question whether independent library boards
and library districts will remain unaffected (p. 387).
</blockquote>
<p>The above line suggests the need to understand more about the
relationship between the Depression, federal government efforts to
combat it, and the rise of public libraries. This would be the kind of
research project very much in line with what many of these early
<em>LQ</em> authors are trying to push (sociological, economical,
political lines of inquiry).</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Important comment on the relationship between
libraries and government:</p>
<blockquote>
The second assumption results from a hazy conception of the place of the
library in the government structure. State provisions for library
support assume that public libraries should have little or no relation
to other governmental agencies. The bogey of "politics" and the
battle-cry, "Keep politics out of the library," have resulted in the
establishment of independent boards with segregated funds and separate
powers. But here also the forces of centralization are at work, and
there is a tendency to modify the position of independent boards. This
tendency is especially noticeable in city manager cities where the
librarian is made directly responsible to the city manager, and the
library board is either entirely dispensed with or given advisory power
only. Students of political science have contended that independent
boards with segregated funds and separate powers are harmful; that they
complicate governmental machinery by adding additional units to it; and
that they hinder the development of sound budgetary and fiscal practices
(p. 388).

<p><strong>Note:</strong> The fourth article of the fourth issue of the
third volume of <em>The Library Quarterly</em> is titled "Proposals
Submitted to the American Library Association for Study and
Investigation."</p>
<p>It was written by Charles H. Brown, Carleton B. Joeckel, Ralph Munn,
C. C. Williamson, and Louis R. Wilson, who were affiliated with:</p>
<p><strong>Affiliation:</strong> Advisory Board for the Study of Special
Projects</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> ALA establishes a committee to help determine
priority and coverage of research fronts in librarianship. The authors,
serving on this committee, take into consideration a list of proposals
that have been submitted to ALA in the previous years by various members
and other entities. The committee categorizes, ranks, and charts the
progress these areas of research.</p>
<p>One of the stated purposes of this study reflects the nature of our
field and its complexity, but also something about science in
general:</p>
<blockquote>
Publication of this report in the present form is primarily intended to
serve two closely related purposes. The first is to draw a clear
distinction between service studies, which are often best undertaken
locally in terms of actual conditions that render the problem acute, and
research of genuine theoretical value to the profession at large (p.
391).
</blockquote>
<p>This purpose mirrors the scientific enterprise in the following
way:</p>
<ol>
<li>Some studies seek to add factual knowledge about the world or the
state of affairs</li>
<li>Some studies seek to test theory (or higher order concepts)</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> This is an important report as it lays out
what the authors and the field, in general, have in mind in regards to
the values held by the field and its domain. It highlights what research
has been completed on certain topics, where research needs to direct its
attention, etc.</p>
<p>The general outline of the research is:</p>
<blockquote>
I. Readers and reading
II. Reading matter, publications
III. Administration of distributing agencies
</blockquote>

href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/4302034">http://www.jstor.org/stable/4302034</a></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The first article of the first issue of the
fourth volume of <em>The Library Quarterly</em> is titled "The
Democratic Function of Public Libraries."</p>
<p>It was written by Grace O. Kelley, who was affiliated with:</p>
<p><strong>Affiliation:</strong> Queens Borough Public Library</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> And this is one of the core beliefs about
(free) public libraries:</p>
<blockquote>
Of all such essays none has been more truly democratic and liberal in
motive, or, dare we say, in some respects naïve, than the creation of
the free public library (p. 1).
</blockquote>
<p>This article does not take the above notion granted. Instead it
examines, and perhaps, criticizes the notion. Such that:</p>
<blockquote>
Today, economic and political conditions are such that librarians are
being forced to examine these broad assumptions to find out what measure
of truth lies therein; to determine more clearly the actual relation
which exists between the library and the people whom it serves; and to
explain the nature and to justify the results of library service. They
are realizing that the hoped-for ends are not implicit nor realized
automatically, but that "critical attention" to the direction and
character of its growth" is needed if the public library is to be a
"true agency for education" (p. 3).
</blockquote>
<p>Again, this is written during the Great Depression.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> If there has been a paradigm shift, in a
slightly Kuhnian sense but more cultural, then it happened because of a
gestalt switch in how libraries have been conceived over time:</p>
<blockquote>
Before the appearance of the free library as we know it today it is
worth noting that the word "library" had a different meaning. The
precursors of the public library had been the private libraries, the
proprietary, academy, and society libraries, the college, university,
and state libraries, none of these wholly free or tax-supported. The
right of using the books was usually granted only to those who met
prescribed conditions as to education, fees, and membership, although it
is doubtless true that the serious student could obtain the privilege
without subscribing to all of the conditions (p. 4).
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Just a tidbit -- the author uses the term
"library world" on page 5. Earliest record of the use of that term?</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> On special libraries -- the term
<em>special</em> is in quotes in the previous sentence (unquoted):</p>
<blockquote>
The special library, so called for want of a better term, is the direct
and inevitable product of the machine age and of the era of
specialization in all fields of knowledge. Wealth has increased,
education has expanded, and occupational opportunities have changed,
releasing vast numbers from routine work and making it necessary for
them to prepare themselves for other kinds of activity. The older
professions have increased their numbers and have required that their
employees meet definite educational standards (p. 5).
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The relation of special library and other
libraries to the topic of this article, the free public library:</p>
<blockquote>
Thus, before and since the era of the free public library, all other
libraries have been almost entirely selective institutions established
for use under prescribed conditions. Particular needs of certain classes
of readers have been met. With the exception of the proprietary
libraries, the various types which existed before the public library
continue to function today in increased strength and numbers. To these
have been added the highly selective special library, a direct outgrowth
of the present age of specialization (p. 7).
</blockquote>
<p>And in light of these contrasting libraries:</p>
<blockquote>
In distinction to all of these, the function of the free public library
has been to serve the people as a whole, collectively; the masses, the
general public, the ordinary folk, were to be supplied with books in
preparation for the duties which democracy was thrusting upon them (p.
7).
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Important distinction between public education
and public libraries, in terms of control from above:</p>
<blockquote>
Where in education youth is guided and regimented in its activity by
state-supported teachers who are influenced by the authority of
tradition in the form of established curricula, the only guide for
service to the clientèle of the library has been the variety of reading
interests of library patrons as interpreted by the librarian. True,
occasional social pressures restricting the librarian's choice have been
brought to bear in the way of censorship of certain books; the actual
effect of this, however, has been small in comparison with the total
amount of freedom enjoyed (p. 8).
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Nice point about what it means to be a
librarian given that library use is not at all obligatory by anyone:</p>
<blockquote>
The librarian must use his ingenuity and tact to the utmost to arouse
and hold his patrons, the actual use of the library never being
obligatory in any way, but resulting always from the purely voluntary
urge of the patron (p. 9).
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> As relevant a discussion point today as
then:</p>
<blockquote>
"An industrial civilization founded on technology, science, invention,
and expanding markets must of necessity change and change rapidly." Any
institution which does not change too, adapt itself to the times, and
become part of the onward "drive to change," will be pushed aside to be
left perhaps for a time to make a harmless life of its own (p. 10).
</blockquote>
<p>The quote is from footnote 16:</p>
<blockquote>
C. A. Beard, <strong>A Charter for the social sciences in the
schools</strong> (New York, 1932), pp. 28, 31.
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> On page 12, the author discusses the
<em>recent</em> development of reader adviser services.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Interesting argument about the role of
librarians at the end of the article --- to make accessible specialized
research to the general public in a form that the general public will
appreciate.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> The Depression is really becoming evident in

</blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Examining not just libraries but democracy
itself:</p>
<blockquote>
It is by way of being platitudinous to say that the country and age in
which we live are constitutionally democratic, but it may be valuable to
recall and examine the assumption from time to time, particularly with
regard to certain aspects of institution control and management as these
are currently practiced (p. 16).
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Interesting turn. This article is about the
management of libraries and how democratic their practices are. First
the author writes about book selection and incorporating the entire
staff, next the author writes about composing annual reports, and then
the author provides other examples. This would make an good, historical
article for a library admin / management course.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> True today?</p>
<blockquote>
Corporate wealth has given up within the past twelve months more power
than in any previous decade; labor now meets the representatives of
government, industry, and the public on equal terms, and the voice of
the employee, speaking through the new trade codes, has more authority
and receives more attention than at almost any time in our history since
the earliest colonial days (p. 19).
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The above is followed with remarks on the
administration and organization of universities. Important higher
education comments here.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> On the evolution of librarianship:</p>
<blockquote>
To be sure, the librarians-collector, the librarians-bibliographer, and
the librarians-scholar of an older day have largely given place to, or
been combined with, the librarian-organizer and executive of today (p.
24).
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Ends with some provoking questions:</p>
<blockquote>
In short, is not the change from the present fairly autocratic
administration of libraries to a more or less completely active,
participating, democratic one an almost inevitable change to which we
ought and must look forward, a change which should be aided in every
way, and one for which librarians should prepare and be prepared (p.
27)?

<p>It was written by Hermann Fuchs, who was affiliated with:</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> The article is on the development of a union
catalog of most of the major libraries in Germany at the time. It's odd
reading an article like this knowing a bit about what's happening in
German in 1934 (e.g., Hitler was Chancellor of Germany at this time) and
what will happen in just a few years from this date.</p>
<p>In fact, I just did a search on Fuchs and it seems he became a

<p>All of the sudden, this article is really hard to read.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> In light of future developments, it's also odd
to read about American involvement in the creation of this union
catalog:</p>
<blockquote>
On January 1, 1933, help arrived on a grand scale. The Rockefeller
Foundation, in order not only to double the editorial staff but also to
aid the participating libraries, granted the funds for five years which
make it possible, though not without sacrifice, to do the necessary
additional work (pp. 46-47).
</blockquote>
<p>And:</p>
<blockquote>
Equally gratefully they [the participating libraries] welcome the
support offered by the American Library Association and the
Bibliographical Society of America in soliciting subscribers for the
<strong>Gesamtkatalog</strong> in the United States (p. 47).

<p>I don't know if anyone has pursued research on ALA's relationship

<p><strong>Note:</strong> This is a nice piece on the importance of
doing good cataloging work and on the lack of understanding that some

cataloging work (and the associated costs). Good article to cite in case
I do more work related to the historical view of librarians by

<p><strong>Note:</strong> Quotes Charles Martel, then "chief of the
Catalog Division of the Library of Congress" (p. 67). See footnotes for
information about the Martel papers to read. The author indicates that
this material should be,</p>
<blockquote>
read and re-read by those who ever and anon feel called on to attack the
catalogues which aim to give somewhat full and explicit information (p.
67).
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> And this is essentially the modern agenda:</p>
<blockquote>
The arguments so far presented may be summed up as follows: (1)
curtailment and omission of information and a lowering of standards of
academic and professional training required from the cataloguing staff
are not sound economy; (2) not only must the staff be permitted to make
the bibliographical investigations necessary to insure an accurate and
satisfactory entry, but it must be encouraged in these efforts; (3)
competent supervision and revision must be provided to insure a proper
correlation of results, harmony, and unity of interpretations and
decisions; (4) the road to sound economy lies through the cooperation of
many libraries---the more the better---agreement on rules and methods,
and the establishment of a central authority to insure unity of effort
(p. 71).

<p><strong>Note:</strong> The seventh article of the first issue of the
fourth volume of <em>The Library Quarterly</em> is titled "A Study of
the Relationship between Reading Interest and Actual Reading."</p>
<p>It was written by Leon Carnovsky, who was affiliated with:</p>
<p><strong>Affiliation:</strong> University of Chicago</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> This is the fourth article by Carnovsky. He
has an article in each volume so far.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> As with Carnovsky's first article in
<em>LQ</em>, this is an article about adult education and adult reading.
He writes:</p>
<blockquote>
When the Graduate Library School was established at the University of
Chicago, the field of adult reading was recognized as one directly
pertinent to the primary objectives of librarianship and as a field of
great social importance in itself. It was felt that cultivation of the
field might serve to clarify certain fundamental objectives of public
libraries, college libraries, and other agencies for the distribution of
substantial literature (p. 78).
</blockquote>
<p>Then he provides an outline, with research questions, of what this
field of adult reading seeks to ask. Quoted in part (questions
omitted):</p>
<blockquote>
A. Reading matter available
B. Reading population
C. The demand for reading
D. The status of reading
E. Consumption of reading
F. Effects of reading (p. 78).
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Nice quote:</p>
<blockquote>
For the union between book and reader is a much more complex phenomenon
than might appear at first glance (p. 79).
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Much mention of Waples' work on reading. See
previous articles by Waple in <em>LQ</em>:</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Inasmuch as this article is about preferences
(reading), Carnovsky does a wonderful job revealing how complicated
preferences are and how complicated it is to measure them. Consider the
following passage. Carnovsky makes a go at measuring preferences, but he
hedges his bets:</p>
<blockquote>
But if it were possible to measure, however roughly, the extent to which
the objective factors have been present and thus have influenced
reading, it would be possible to understand their influences as
affecting reading interests. In the following discussion an approach is
made to the problem of indicating and measuring certain factors whose
presence or absence probably bears a definite relationship to the
reading done (p. 83).
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> This is a long, detailed article and what
Carnovsky is trying to do is to, begin at least, establish some causal
factors that lead to reading particular works. Or at least have a
discussion about the possibility of that. He knows it's big game hunting
and that he's not going to accomplish it with this study (which is
nicely described), but the goal seems to be his main agenda.</p>

<p>It was written by John Ansteinsson, who was affiliated with:</p>
<p><strong>Affiliation:</strong> Tekniske Höiskole</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The author wrestles with some very fundamental
problems with classification, and these problems deal not only with
<em>aboutness</em> but also with direction. Consider an experiment by a
chemist and one by a physicist, each examining much the same thing but
from different perspectives:</p>
<blockquote>
The subjects of the two investigations are to a large extent identical,
the results coincide almost entirely, or at least to such an extent that
the two authors are disputing over the priority. Nevertheless, the
problem has been attacked by them from different points of view, even
with different aims in view, and in any case through different methods.
The one probably is physical chemistry, the other one perhaps chemical
physics. According to the two systems of classification most in use in
America, the one would go into physics, the other into chemistry. But
the walls of our pigeonholes are smashed to pieces by the incessant
bombardment of radiations from the restless atoms oscillating between
our nicely built-up compartments, all of which want to occupy the same
space in our system (p. 140).
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> On a book with many topics:</p>
<blockquote>
Are we to pick our book to pieces and scatter it in the various places
in the system where the different parts belong, or are we to put it into
one of them which will do justice to only a minor part of the contents
(p. 141)?
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> What I enjoy about these early classification
and cataloging articles is how well they bring to light the attempt to
form and complete a rational system.</p>

them at the time.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Note on systems of charging:</p>
<blockquote>
The old charging ledgers in book form had been given up before his time,
but he exchanged the established slip system with another of English
origin. During a short stay in England in 1900 he became acquainted with
the American Browne system, which he introduced upon his return. Some
years later (1908), the Browne system was also abandoned on account of
its slow operation at the delivery desk. It was replaced by the Newark
system, which at that time was already in use in other Norwegian
libraries (p. 151).

<p><strong>Note:</strong> The fifth article of the second issue of the
fourth volume of <em>The Library Quarterly</em> is titled "J. C. M.
Hanson and International Cataloging."</p>
<p>It was written by William Warner Bishop, who was affiliated with:</p>
<p><strong>Affiliation:</strong> University of Michigan Library</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> A nice intro that puts cataloging in
historical perspective from the 1934 vantage point:</p>
<blockquote>
Few of the younger librarians of the present day can realize or fully
understand the situation of cataloging in the nineties of the last
century. Libraries in Britain and America were mostly small, as we now
count numbers. In Europe there were more of the sizeable sort, almost
all of the learned or "scientific" type. What agreement on cataloging
practice had been reached in any country was chiefly based on certain
well-known codes intended for very large libraries---the British Museum
Rules, the <strong>Bodleian rules</strong>, the Bibliothèque Nationale
rules, and the foreshadowings of the Prussian and the Austrian
<strong>Instructions</strong>. In America, breaking away in part from
these examples, Mr. Cutter had published two editions of his
<strong>Rules for a dictionary catalogue</strong>, first in 1876. There
were certain practices reduced to rules by the New York State Library
School (p. 165).
</blockquote>
<p>The paragraph continues. What strikes me about it is that even
Cutter's rules today are presented as if they were created *ex nihilo*.
This paragraph, all by itself, puts the entire enterprise in
context.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The following is an interesting footnote.
After making a statement, Bishop writes in footnote 6:</p>
<blockquote>
I am writing this on the ocean far from any books of reference for
verifying what I trust are fairly accurate recollections (p. 165).
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> As far as I can tell, there is finally a
straightforward indication that this issue is dedicated to J. C. M.
Hanson. On Hanson's work to develop "preliminary edition of the
Anglo-American <em>Code of catalog rules</em> (p. 166), Bishop
writes:</p>
<blockquote>
No one claims it is perfect, but it is a great piece of constructive
work, due to the labor of many able men, but guided by one whom we honor
in this group of articles (p. 167).
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Nice explanation of the intent behind the
above named rules. This has been the intent of various rules and schemes
(perhaps but more broadly) unto this day:</p>
<blockquote>
One feature of Hanson's work is but little understood. His aim---and
that of his committee---was to make a code usable and indispensable for
great libraries, but also capable of being followed in smaller and more
popular libraries without serious vexation and undue confusion (p. 167).
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> This achievement cannot be understated:</p>
<blockquote>
Ninety-nine out of a hundred titles in the ordinary library can be and
are cataloged with printed cards made under this code. It requires a
genius for concrete statements and for clearness to make this sort of
result possible (p. 167).

<blockquote>
I feel very much honored by the request to furnish a brief article on
some library subject for the number of <em>Library quarterly</em>
devoted to my esteemed former chief of the Catalog Division of the
Library of Congress (p. 179).
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> I like this if only because it provides some
insight into the academic background on the author (a librarian):</p>
<blockquote>
In 1900 he [J. C. M. Hanson] recommended me for a position in the
Library of Congress as revisor of cataloging---I am sure rather on the
strength of personal knowledge of my philological degree from the
University of Oslo than for the reason of my slight seven years'
experience as a cataloger and later librarian of the Field Museum of
Natural History, Chicago (p. 179).
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The article is, as the title suggests, about
the use and rules of abbreviations in cataloging. It is, at times,
humorous. Some remarks on enforcing a practice of collecting daily
statistics on the daily work of LC catalogers:</p>
<blockquote>
From my own experience of some forty years I unhesitatingly say that
this would spell disaster to the accuracy of the output, in addition to
reducing the force to a nervous, irritated body of works with chronic
dyspepsia (p. 183).

<p><strong>Note:</strong> The ninth article of the second issue of the
fourth volume of <em>The Library Quarterly</em> is titled "The
University of Chicago Libraries: A Historical Note."</p>
<p>It was written by A. Th. Dorf, who was affiliated with:</p>
<p><strong>Affiliation:</strong> Brooklyn, New York (No Affiliation)</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> This article is a valuable history of both J.
C. M. Hanson's work at the University of Chicago Libraries but also of
the libraries themselves. Any future work on the history of libraries
should reference this article and its contents.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Nice quote:</p>
<blockquote>
It was one of Mr. Hanson's axioms that "there is no short-cut to
anything, least of all in library science" ... (p. 196).
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Might be interesting to examine someday, as a
thesis / hypothesis:</p>
<blockquote>
Nor did he hesitate to point out, which is customary honesty, that the
larger the library the more costly the addition of each book.
"Increasing perfection and completeness of the catalogs reduce expense,
but growth will of itself increase it" (p. 196).
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Important historical note on Hanson's view of
librarianship:</p>
<blockquote>
It remains to say a word about the development of a library staff. Mr.
Hanson himself was an excellent, though a severe, teacher. His own
standards were high, and he insisted that these standards be maintained
by his staff. Some of this staff he brought with him from the Library of
Congress; others he himself trained to the special needs of the
university library. It was his firm conviction that the library science
was an exacting one, and he insisted that assistants serve an
apprenticeship before they were given positions of responsibility. The
chief bibliographer, for example, was required to work for several years
in the bookstacks and the classification department before he was given
an opportunity to work in his special field (p. 196).
</blockquote>
<p>And:</p>
<blockquote>
Mr. Hanson was particularly anxious to avoid, in library work, the
narrow specialization that is characteristic of so much of American
life. Foreign library journals and publications were distributed among
the members of the staff who, in his opinion, had the maturity to profit
by them, and they were given an opportunity to review these articles at
the regular monthly meetings of the staff where the various problems of
the library administration came up for discussion (p. 197).

href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/4302065">http://www.jstor.org/stable/4302065</a></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The eleventh article of the second issue of
the fourth volume of <em>The Library Quarterly</em> is titled "The
Classification of Books in Libraries."</p>
<p>It was written by Colman J. Farrell, who was affiliated with:</p>
<p><strong>Affiliation:</strong> The Abbey Library</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> This is a critical review of a book on
classification written by a Henry Evelyn Bliss. It's a good review and
I'm not finding much to discuss, but the author raises are very good
question:</p>
<blockquote>
The all-important question, which Bliss's book raises in the mind of a
classifier of books, is this: why does the author propose to discuss the
problems of book classification and, straightaway, enter into a
discussion of the divisions of knowledge? Even if there were some kind
of identity, why does he choose to discuss the problem in terms of
knowledge rather than in terms of books (p. 213)?
</blockquote>
<p>And then Farrell writes:</p>
<blockquote>
This is not a question of "logical" versus "arbitrary" procedure, but a
question of deductive versus inductive procedure (p. 213).
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> More humor:</p>
<blockquote>
It was a formula which led the man with eight white horses and two black
horses to kill all the white horses when he observed that the white
horses ate more than the black horses (p. 220).
</blockquote>
<p>And so Farrell's criticism in two sentences:</p>
<blockquote>
The method of the author [Bliss], therefore, is to "conceive" classes.
The method of the Library of Congress is to investigate the literature
to "discover" the classes (p. 220).
</blockquote>
<p>It's a delightful critique -- without overtly stating it, it draws
upon a lot of Western philosophy -- including Kant.</p>
<p>And this is very scathing:</p>
<blockquote>
Professors of book classification in library schools will be forever
indebted to Bliss for this capital illustration of the distinction
between book classification and the classification of knowledge, between
the classification of material things as they exist in nature and the
classification of the limited conceptual knowledge as it exists in
individual minds. It is one of those things which fairly defies
explanation until one can illustrate it by means of a concrete example
(p. 221).
</blockquote>
<p>This topic should really be revisited. The argument weighs heavily on
the more modern issue of the <strong>organization of
information</strong> as opposed to the <strong>organization of
things</strong>:</p>
<blockquote>
in the organization of knowledge there can be no correlation of the
abstract with the concrete, but merely a division of an abstract whole
into immaterial parts. The second distinction is found in the procedure:
classification of books is necessarily synthetic; organization of
knowledge can only be analytic (p. 222).
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> After highlighting some of the imperfections
inherent in the Library of Congress classification schedule, Farrell
write:</p>
<blockquote>
The aspect of the Library of Congress classification schedules with
which the present writer has not been able to find fault is the theory
and method which they are grounded. They seem to be unimpeachable; and
it is a most singular and unfortunate phenomenon that the profession as
a whole has remained oblivious, during the past thirty-five years and
apparently to this day, of the true nature of the work being done in the
national library (p. 222).
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> I'm interested in the fact that the author of
this article is a monk of the Order of Saint Benedict (O.S.B) and is
writing from an abbey in Atchison Kansas.</p>

not here): <a

<p><strong>Note:</strong> Presents an image of a small college library.
Historically important for that alone. Important aspect: when the
librarian was hired in 1920, it seems he was given full faculty status.
See page 236, end of 2nd paragraph, for the sentence.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The author, as a librarian, had to reclassify
and re-catalog the collection. Used LC. Students' appreciation of the
library apparently increased as a result of the reorganization and more
used the library and more became interested in librarianship.</p>
<blockquote>
If the constant increase in the use of the books corresponding to the
progress of the re-cataloging process experienced in this library is any
criterion, it certainly would indicate that the character of the catalog
and classification has made a very decided difference in the reaction of
the students toward the library. This is also reflected in a somewhat
different way in the number of students and graduates of the college who
have become interested in librarianship as a life work during the past
ten years (p. 239).
</blockquote>
<p>Good example of the relationship between how the library is presented
to patrons and how often the patrons use the library.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Information-literacy by any other name. On
library instruction:</p>
<blockquote>
For the freshman, two lectures by the college librarian as a part of the
college orientation course have been followed by a practice period in
groups of twenty-five or less. This year an attempt is being made to
supplement this procedure by co-operation with the course in freshman
English (p. 240).
</blockquote>
<p>Detailed account of library instruction follows the above paragraph.
For example:</p>
<blockquote>
This has resulted in what virtually amounts to individual tutoring by
the librarian of the more than 125 freshman. The topics assigned, all
biographical, have been such that to find the material available the
students have had to make use of the various tools of the library,
particularly the catalog and periodical indexes and a considerable
number of reference books, both general and those connected more closely
with the specific topic of the student. In each case the student was
required to look up all the material he could find in the library on his
topic and---except in a few instances where the material was very
extensive and a selection had to be made---to record these references in
accurate bibliographic form (pp. 240-241).
</blockquote>
<p>The librarian graded the above work and that grade was used by the
English professor as part of the final grade. Collaboration.</p>

<p>It was written by Walter Lichtenstein, who was affiliated with:</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> An interesting comment on library schools /
education, which comes after a comment on education as an example of
mass production:</p>
<blockquote>
So also in our library schools much time is spent in teaching pupils how
to catalog, how to order books, how to classify the books for the
shelves when received, what is the best manner of distributing them to
the people, etc. Much less time seems to be spent in teaching what books
really are, what differentiates one book from another, what type of
books a particular library had better specialize in, and how the people
ought to get the most out of libraries (p. 270).
</blockquote>
<p>Although the article begins with some good comments, as above, it
uses those comments as premises to derive invalid conclusions. One of
the conclusions drawn in this article is that library schools cannot
teach people to know books as well the specific academic fields can and,
therefore, academic libraries should be staffed by scholars and not
librarians.</p>
<p>I don't mind arguments against library schools or library education,
but the arguments presented in this article are foolish. The author
would have served his argument better if he had continued his argument
against library education rather than arguing, implicitly by support of
other academic fields, that it could never suffice. This is the first
*LQ* article in these first four volumes that left me rather
annoyed.</p>

in books on science and technology and biographies). For the most part,
this is a weird article. But it, at least, indicates something

<p><strong>Note:</strong> Herein is a really interesting argument about
the advantages that librarians as bibliographers can provide to
scientists who lack the assistants and machinery to produce the
equivalent of what scientists in, as the author explicitly names,
Germany can produce. The author's analogy:</p>
<blockquote>
Does this difference in personnel help permanently to condemn the
American professor to a position of relative inferiority in research
work? This question can perhaps be answered by a comparison with the
American farmer. The latter has also much less help than a western
European farmer, and yet he produces more per man than any other
agriculturalist in the world. He does it through superior organization
of work and through the use of machinery. The same could be true of the
American research worker. What he lacks in assistants and technicians
could, in a measure, be replaced by organization and machinery---both to
be supplied by departments of bibliographic research in university
libraries (p. 300).

<p><strong>Note:</strong> The twenty-third article of the second issue

Forest of Pencils: Adventures in Corporate Entry."</p>
<p>It was written by Harriet Wheeler Pierson, who was affiliated

<p><strong>Affiliation:</strong> Library of Congress</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Probably the best title in these first volumes
so far. Begins with a short history of the Chinese Emporer Taitsung and
his founding of a library that lasted for 1200 years only to be burned
down during the Boxer rebellion in 1900.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Although this is an important and very
complicated topic, I think the following is humorous, and I think, given
how this article reads in general, that it is meant to be humorous (see,
e.g., last paragraph on page 312):</p>
<blockquote>
particularly did he [J. C. M. Hanson] clarify the rules for corporate
entry, a subject more open to differences of opinion than, perhaps, any
other (p. 307).
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Here ya go:</p>
<blockquote>
Catalogers are not only transcribers, they are seekers of truth.
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> I celebrate this author's passion, as I read
her voice from the past.</p>
<blockquote>
To the uninitiated the profession of cataloging may appear dry and
uninteresting; in reality there is no profession which affords so great
an opportunity to look into the mirror of life. The revelation is
absorbing and full of interesting surprises: a glimpse of beauty in some
forgotten volume, a flash of humor from some dusty shelf. The voices of
the past are audible, their joy and pain, their triumph and defeat,
their ambition and resignation, their eager and unending struggle to
solve the mystery of life (p. 313).

<p><strong>Note:</strong> On the most economical and efficient use of
shelving. Again, it's utterly important to think about this kind of
thing in a library. In many ways, this is a very important topic if only
because of the amount of money that is needed to store and care for so
many books. However, it's not really clear why this article is in this
issue. The only connection to Hanson is the issue of describing the
physical dimensions of books in the catalog, but this is only mentioned
briefly at the beginning of the article.</p>
<p>Here's a nice quote:</p>
<blockquote>
We have recently measured about 100,000 volumes at Brown University. The
results are in Table I (p. 355).
</blockquote>
<p>And to continue:</p>
<blockquote>
This paper should be considered merely tentative and incomplete. Our
estimate of 82 per cent for octavos (25 cm. high), Mr. Gerould's
estimate of 85 per cent, and the Yale estimate of 87 1/2 per cent
(reckoning the octavo at 26 cm. high) may not be so different when we
have measured 400,000 volumes instead of 100,000 (p. 357).
</blockquote>
<p>And more measuring of books:</p>
<blockquote>
Four hundred thousand is quite a lot of books to measure, but it may not
be enough, and we should welcome collaboration in further measurements,
tabulations, and conclusions (p. 357).

<p>It was written by Edgar Dale and Ralph W. Tyler, who were affiliated
with:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Affiliation:</strong> Bureau of Educational Research</li>
<li><strong>Affiliation:</strong> Ohio State University</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> This should be an interesting study. It's
about identifying the characteristics of reading material that make the
material easier to comprehend for adults with limited literacy
abilities.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The study will use multiple regression. Until
now, only correlation coefficients with confidence intervals have been
used in these early articles, so this is the most advanced use of
statistics to date in *LQ*. Note that it is written by people outside of
the library science field.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The study, for some reason, includes only
people of color as participants. Not sure why yet. The authors do seek
to generalize to all the population and do, for the most part, seem
respectful of their participants, but some of the remarks seem to be a
bit condescending.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The study includes only personal health
reading material.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Very detailed description of creating and
administering the test.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The authors are checking for reliability and
validity of their test instrument.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> An audience statement:</p>
<blockquote>
For most purposes librarians and others interested in selecting reading
materials of given difficulty will find these three counts valuable (p.
402).
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The authors state their multiple regression
equation and then describe how to use it:</p>
<blockquote>
The use of this regression equation may easily be shown by illustration.
Suppose one wished to select some reading material which are easy enough
so that they would be comprehended by at least 80 per cent of adults who
have from third- to fifth-grade reading ability. Samples of these
selections of similar size to those used in this study could be examined
and the number of different technical words, the number of different
hard, non-technical words, and the number of indeterminate clauses
counted. These counts could then be multiplied by -9.4, -0.4, +2.2,
respectively. The resulting products could then be added to 114.4. If
all the selections were chosen in which the resulting sums were 80 or
higher, we should have those in which the predicted difficulty of
comprehension would be such that the selections would be understood by
80 per cent or more of the adults who have third- to fifth-grade reading
ability. For these selections we should probably find half of them
within 9 per cent of the difficulty predicted. Hence this regression
equation does give a reasonably accurate prediction of the difficulty of
reading materials similar to those used in this study (pp. 402-403).
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The article contains three "exhibits."
Exhibits A, B, and C are samples of the three tests administered in this
study.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> The author defines collateral reading as
"'outside reading'" (p. 421) that is related to coursework.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Brilliant:</p>
<blockquote>
Records kept by the writer over a period of many weeks from two reserve
desks revealed that there are relationships between these factors which
remain constant. The number of students multiplied by the number of
pages each must read will give the total number of pages to be read by
all the students. The number of pages read per hour by the typical
student multiplied by the length of the average loan in terms of an hour
will give the number of pages read by the typical student during one
average loan period. If the first product (the total number of pages) be
divided by the second product (the number of pages read by the typical
student ini one loan period), the number of loans needed for all the
students will be ascertained. Then if this total number of loans be
divided by the number of loans one book may be expected to make in the
given period, the quotient will give the number of books needed. Thus by
an objective method, the number of duplicate copies necessary for a
given class under given conditions may be determined (p. 422).
</blockquote>
<p>It's a common theme that early authors were very concerned with
coming up with objective methods and measures.</p>
<p><em>Library Science</em> arises out of a push for this
objectivity.</p>
<p>Another example:</p>
<blockquote>
The number of pages that an average student can read in an hour was
believed to be a determining factor. From Mr. Ivan A. Booker, assistant
director of research, National Education Association, it was found that
his studies of the reading rates of college freshmen entering the
University of Chicago in the fall term of 1930 and of 1931 revealed the
mean rate of 3.68 words per second for the first year and 3.83 words per
second for the second year (p. 424).
</blockquote>
<p>I couldn't help myself. I just timed my reading of this article and
clocked myself in at 6.25 words per second (375 words in 60 seconds). I
guess I beat college freshmen from 1930.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> As I said, brilliant. After proposing a
formula for determining how many reserve books a course will need, she
tests it:</p>
<blockquote>
At Western Kentucky State Teachers College an instructor in a psychology
class purchased with department funds five copies of Warren and
Carmichael's <strong>Human Psychology</strong>. He placed them at the
reserve desk with the comment that these were believed to be sufficient.
Two weeks elapsed and he came to say that his students were complaining
that they did not have enough books. With facts about his class and the
assignment furnished, the librarian used the formula to determine how
many copies his class needed.
</blockquote>
<p>&gt;</p>
<blockquote>
a = 50 students in the class
b = Approximately 50 pages to be read per week
c = 28 pages read per hour by the typical student
k<sub>1</sub> = 0.62 hours (37 min.) per average loan
k<sub>2</sub> = 19 loans per average week
</blockquote>
<p>&gt;</p>
<blockquote>
Substituting in the formula, we get
</blockquote>
<p>&gt;</p>
<blockquote>
a X b / c X k<sub>1</sub> / k<sub>2</sub> =
50 X 50 / 28 X 0.62 / 19 =
50 X 50 / 28 X 0.62 X 19 =
7+, or 8 copies (p. 432).
</blockquote>
<p>Incapable of reproducing the exact representation of the above
calculations.</p>
<p>She then writes:</p>
<blockquote>
The five copies had evidently been too few. The instructor agreed to
purchase three extra copies, and no further difficulties were reported
throughout the three remaining months of the semester. Since each copy
is good for about nineteen loans to a week, the class was short
fifty-seven loans. No wonder they were in trouble. The instructor was
completely converted to the efficacy of the formula (p. 433).
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Reflection:</strong> This is an important article not because
of the findings but because it represents a way of going about solving a
problem that was representative of the time period and of the beginnings
of library science.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> The fifth article of the third issue of the
fourth volume of <em>The Library Quarterly</em> is titled "The Need of
College and University Instruction in Use of the Library."</p>
<p>It was written by Peyton Hurt, who was affiliated with:</p>
<p><strong>Affiliation:</strong> University of California</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> This will be an important article too --
simply because of its topic matter. However, I'm always surprised by
this expectation:</p>
<blockquote>
College and university librarians are repeatedly astonished at the lack
of knowledge of library technique on the part of students, research
workers, and even on the part of instructors (p. 436).
</blockquote>
<p>Why would they have the expectation that any of these people would
have the necessary skills?</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> This is one of those studies that show we
still ask the same kinds of general questions today.</p>
<blockquote>
There is a question, however, of just how much or how little the average
person knows of the technique of using a library as a source of
information on subjects that interest him personally (p. 436).
</blockquote>
<p>And:</p>
<blockquote>
How much does the undergraduate and the graduate student, in the course
of his college and university studies, learn concerning methods of using
a library (p. 436)?
</blockquote>
<p>And:</p>
<blockquote>
What changes, if any, are needed in our educational system if we are to
develop a greater degree of student independence and initiative in using
the library as a source of information (p. 436)?
</blockquote>
<p>The last question is especially important. Note the desired outcome:
student independence. Long the goal of academic libraries.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> One of the subtle points of this article seems
to be that reference is an overused substitute for solid library use
instruction. That's an interesting point. Take the following:</p>
<blockquote>
One familiar with the library research methods employed by the great
majority of students must realize that this independent work is far too
often work for the library assistant, with little beneficial training
for the student (p. 443).
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> And this is a brilliant passage:</p>
<blockquote>
It would seem fair to ask if it would not be advisable to teach the use
of library materials and then throw the students into the ponds of
economics, history, biology, and other subjects, to the abandonment of
the time-honored method of instruction by lectures and assigned reading.
Would not such procedure lead to continued study and reading on the part
of those who become interested in various subjects? Would it not tend to
create independence and initiative which would be highly useful after
college courses were a thing of the past? Would it not pave the way for
intelligent adult self-education (p. 443)?
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Library use instruction:</p>
<blockquote>
As a result of the present study, the university is introducing a course
in library use and general bibliography. The course, under the School of
Librarianship, will be open to upper division and graduate students in
all fields, but will be designed especially to meet the needs of
students in the social sciences (p. 444).
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Need to come back to this article in the
future. Aside from the topic matter, the article is historically
interesting for its listing of general reference works and library
methods that were considered necessary at the time.</p>

<p>It was written by Dimitry M. Krassovsky, who was affiliated with:</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> It is interesting to read a library science

<p><strong>Reflection:</strong> Mental note: Incorporate bibliographical
and bio-bibliographical work.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Nice turn a phrase the captures what a library
is without people to use it:</p>
<blockquote>
The revolution gave impetus to the development of libraries, and the
introduction of technical facilities made of them not "cemeteries of
books" but living bodies (p. 461).
</blockquote>
<p>In essence, library science is the study of library as a living body
-- of its health, its use, its betterment, etc.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> The seventh article of the third issue of the

<p>It was written by H. P. Spratt, who was affiliated with:</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> These are actual notes. The first paragraph
explains that what follows are simply notes the author took on a tour of
"some of the most important scientific and technical libraries of seven
nations in Northern Europe" (p. 467). Spratt writes:</p>
<blockquote>
The notes which follow should therefore be accepted as an objective
review; those who do n ot look for a philosophical treatise will not be
disappointed (p. 467).
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Spratt describes the use of an "'Adrema'
machine" that was adapted for information retrieval. See page 476. Not
much on the general web about this device. This site outlines the use of
this device by the Nazis for documenting forced laborers: <a

<p><strong>Note:</strong> Author describes a really cool public library
in Stadsbiblioteket, Stockholm. Although this article is a rather
straightforward, dry description of libraries, this is rather more
lively:</p>
<blockquote>
In the children's department, which is beautifully decorated and
furnished with miniature chairs, tables, and bookshelves, there is the
remarkable Story-Teller's Room. Seats for fifty children are set out in
semicircular rows in front of a recess in which the story-teller sits
and talks about fairies and "trolls" for an hour every afternoon. The
walls are decorated with all kinds of fantasies, and the roof is an
enormous umbrella (p. 483).
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The author speaks to a different topic, but
this is, at heart, the agenda of the time:</p>
<blockquote>
to rationalize the work of the library (pp. 484-485).

<p>Danton, J. Periam. (1934). Plea for a Philosophy of Librarianship:
Philosophia vero omnium mater artium. <em>The Library Quarterly,
4</em>(4), 527-551. url:<a
href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/4302121">http://www.jstor.org/stable/4302121</a></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The first article of the fourth issue of the
fourth volume of <em>The Library Quarterly</em> is titled "Plea for a
Philosophy of Librarianship: Philosophia vero omnium mater artium."</p>
<p>It was written by J. Periam Danton, who was affiliated with:</p>
<p><strong>Affiliation:</strong> University of Chicago</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> This is probably the most cited article from
these first few volumes.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Equates librarianship with library science by
applying one definition to the two terms:</p>
<blockquote>
Librarianship or library science is that branch of learning which has to
do with the recognition, collection, organization, preservation, and
utilization of graphic and printed records (pp. 528-529).
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> First reference to Ranganathan's *Five laws of
library science*. Danton writes:</p>
<blockquote>
But this treatise, as stimulating and interesting as it undoubtedly is,
does not attempt to define the functions of library activity on any
other bases than that of present-day good library service; ... (p. 532).
</blockquote>
<p>So it's interesting that S. R. Ranganathan's book had sparked some
discussions at this early of a date.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> A one sentence summary of Danton's
criticism:</p>
<blockquote>
The crux of the matter is that the librarian has thus far concerned
himself almost exclusively with process, achievement, and the immediate
objective, and has given little or no thought to function or to
justifying that function (p. 533).
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Danton addresses my above remark:</p>
<blockquote>
The term "librarianship" may be said to be equivalent to "library
science" (p. 535).
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> On science and philosophy (important to note
for, at the very least, having a historical understanding of their use
of the terms):</p>
<blockquote>
Any science deals fundamentally with the acquisition of facts and data;
the description of those data through definition, analysis, and
classification; explanation of them by the ascertainment of causes; and,
finally, evaluation and the formulation of laws. Science concerns itself
directly with concrete phenomena. A philosophy, on the other hand, is
interested in aims and functions, in purpose and meaning (pp. 535-536).
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The aesthetic factor:</p>
<blockquote>
In contrast, although a philosophy of librarianship would be vitally
interested, indirectly, in the scientifically derived data on reading
interests, abilities, etc., it would be primarily concerned with
purpose---that is, with finding out whether librarianship should concern
itself with the question at all, and if so why... (p. 536).
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Reflection:</strong> It's too often ignored --- that science
without philosophy and philosophy without science is impossible. To
pretend that the relationship does not exist is, also, dangerous.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> I'm taking this out of context but I think
it's an important example of what Danton thinks is an instance of the
science of librarianship in practice. The preceding sentences, not
quoted here, are important in that they reference some of the authors
that have dominated these early volumes of <em>LQ</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
It should be noted, too, that one phase of library work---is, in a not
very different sense, scientific in its approach and techniques. This is
enumerative bibliography which, at its best, is the examination,
description, and listing of books in accordance with certain
well-defined principles and by means of a more or less universally
accepted terminology (p. 538).
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Beginning at the top of page 540, good
criticism on the lack of interest in libraries by sociologists,
political scientists, etc. Need to come back to this someday.
Interesting / respectful quote by a Wesley C. Mitchell that responds to
this lack of treatment and attention.</p>
<p>Danton, though, soundly rejects Mitchell's argument.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> More aesthetic. See Danton's concrete example
at the top of page 544.</p>
<p><strong>Reflection:</strong> The *LQ* pushes the library science in
the first volumes, and now pushes the philosophy of library science.</p>
<p><strong>Reflection:</strong> I should have reread this article before
I submitted my Parker piece. The discussion about isolation in the first
paragraph of section 6 on page 546 would have been useful to add.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Important discussion about the necessity of
libraries on pages 548-549. They may or may not be, Danton seems to
argue, but if we state they are, then that statement needs to be
justified and not simply taken as an ideological presupposition.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> The third article of the fourth issue of the

were affiliated with:</p>
<p><strong>Affiliation:</strong> Iowa State College Library</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Although this article is about library use,
some of the questions the authors raise in the first paragraph border on
information behavior questions.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> This is a very thorough piece. Mentions the
need for a qualitative study and I haven't seen that term used before in
these early issues.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Data collection and research questions:</p>
<blockquote>
Three methods were used for the collection of data: (1) count and
analysis of attendance, (2) personal interviews, (3) count and analysis
of slips for books charged over the assigned reading desk. An attempt
was made to answer four questions: How many students use the library?
For what purpose do students come to the library? Why do students fail
to get what they want? What is the nature of the use of reserved books?
</blockquote>
<p>The authors pretested their interview questions.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Important passage about information desires
and librarians:</p>
<blockquote>
Five or six of the students who failed to obtain the material desired
were not very complimentary to the library in their expressions of
dissatisfaction. Students, like most of the rest of us, "want what they
want when they want it." One observant student complained that "the
perpetual costume of a librarian seems to be a frown" (p. 582).
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The daily use number, given the student
enrollment, is a bit high.</p>
<blockquote>
The mean daily use of the library at Iowa State College was 4,200
volumes. The student enrollment was 3,384.

<p><strong>Note:</strong> Technical article on cataloging union lists of
periodicals. This is proto stuff --- signifies some of the complicated
problems that librarians were dealing with as scientific communication
really began to take off. Nice example of the problem:</p>
<blockquote>
Incidentally, the arrangement here suggested will meet, perhaps better
than any other, Mr. Smith's requirements of a union list, where he says:
"The purpose of a Union List of periodicals is to enable a researcher to
discover where he may consult a given periodical, from a reference which
is generally not completely accurate, is frequently abbreviated, and is
sometimes truncated to the point of lunacy" (p. 621).
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> There's a good point on the importance of
typesetting the list of periodicals so that the list is readable. We
might call this a usability issue now.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> I have no idea what "H.C.F." means. Aside from
looking up some references the author points to, the main clue is
this:</p>
<blockquote>
By that I mean that the all-important arranging word---the
"H.C.F."---occurs as part of their titles" (p. 611).

writes something about a school and a library collection on
librarianship:</p>
<blockquote>
There is a special "library of librarianship" with a collection of 3,000
volumes, so comprehensive that even some of the present writer's
articles are to be found there (if looked for). Finally, I was shown the
school of librarianship, where students learn the use of decimal
classification and so forth (p. 630).
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> After describing a number of libraries in
Poland, the author moves on to libraries in Helsinki and then to
Russia.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Just kind of interesting -- about the
"<em>Central Transport Library, Leningrad</em>":</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> The eighth article of the fourth issue of the
fourth volume of <em>The Library Quarterly</em> is titled "Graduate
Theses Accepted by Library Schools in the United States during the
Academic Year 1932-1933."</p>
<p>It was written Douglas Waples, who was affiliated with:</p>
<p><strong>Affiliation:</strong> University of Chicago</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> This a continuation of this article: <a
href="https://cseanburns.net/wiki/lq/volume-3-issue-3#article-4">[Waples,
1933</a></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The article is a simple bibliography. The
introduction mentions the previous year's article and then introduces
this one. Waples writes:</p>
<blockquote>
Thirty-six graduate theses were accepted this year by four schools,
namely: California, seven; Chicago, two; Columbia, thirteen; and
Illinois, fourteen.
</blockquote>
<p>Waples then distributes the theses under the thirteen headings he
created in the previous article. It's an interesting mix. Three of his
subject headings are dedicated to some facet of bibliography:</p>
<ul>
<li>enumerative bibliography</li>
<li>descriptive bibliography</li>
<li>critical bibliography</li>
</ul>
<p>*Reflection:* I really would like to look at a lot these theses some
day.</p>

<p>Bowerman, George F. (1934). Shall the Library Board Be Retained?
<em>The Library Quarterly, 4</em>(4), 642-651. url:<a
href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/4302129">http://www.jstor.org/stable/4302129</a></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The ninth article of the fourth issue of the
fourth volume of <em>The Library Quarterly</em> is titled "Shall the
Library Board Be Retained?"</p>
<p>It was written George F. Bowerman, who was affiliated with:</p>
<p><strong>Affiliation:</strong> Public Library (Washington, D.C.)</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Public library governance was a major concern
at the time. Not just the quality of governance, but the actual system
of governance. Off the cuff, I think this is the fourth article on the
broad topic (but there may be more) in these early volumes. The three I
can immediately recall are:</p>
<p>- <a
href="https://cseanburns.net/wiki/lq/volume-1-issue-2#article-1">Joeckel,
1931a</a> - <a
href="https://cseanburns.net/wiki/lq/volume-1-issue-3#article-6">Joeckel,
1931b</a> - <a
href="https://cseanburns.net/wiki/lq/volume-3-issue-4#article-3">Wachtel,
1933</a></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> One apparently persistent theme is a tension
between public libraries and institutions of public education. Consider
lines like this:</p>
<blockquote>
The specialized interests of the library should not be jeopardized by
being merged with, and submerged by, the overshadowing interests of the
schools (p. 644).
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Important historical perspective:</p>
<blockquote>
The recognized authoritative publication on the public library in
America is <strong>The American public library</strong> by Dr. Arthur E.
Bostwick, librarian of the St. Louis Public Library and former president
of the American Library Association (p. 646).
</blockquote>
<p>The author quotes both Bostwick and Joeckel.</p>

<p>Nice article on the importance of the library board.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> The tenth article of the fourth issue of the
fourth volume of <em>The Library Quarterly</em> is titled "Fritz Milkau,
September 28, 1859-January 23, 1934."</p>
<p>It was written J. C. M. Hanson, who was affiliated with:</p>
<p><strong>Affiliation:</strong> No Affiliation (Sister Bay,
Wisconsin)</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> From his retirement, Hanson writes this
tribute to Fritz Milkau, an important German librarian.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> As a side note, I haven't researched the
length it took for these articles to go from submission to publication,
but the death of Milkau (end of January) and the publication of this
article (last volume of the year) provides a bit of a clue. Other
articles have mentioned current years (the last one did), so my guess
would be that it took less than a year for an article to go through the
process.</p>
<p><strong>Reflection:</strong> This is the last article in my
study.</p>
