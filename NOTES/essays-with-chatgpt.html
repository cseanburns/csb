                <h2>What's This About</h2>
                <p>Yes, sometimes I have long conversations with ChatGPT.
                It usually starts with an idea I have about some topic, and after we've worked through the idea a bit,
                I'll ask ChatGPT to write an essay based on our exchange.
                Below is a list of essays I've asked ChatGPT to write based on ideas I've had and our conversations.</p>

                <p>While ChatGPT wrote these essays (and their titles), the ideas are mine and were flushed out through conversation.</p>
