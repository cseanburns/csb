  <h2>Abstract</h2>
  <p>Ungrading is an umbrella term that refers to a variety of approaches
to decenter grades and to center learning. The goal of this paper is to
discuss ungrading methods as a way to foster learning. To accomplish
this, the paper provides a brief historical overview of grading, offers
a critical view of grading practices, and discusses some approaches to
ungrading that might be explored by faculty.</p>

<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
<p>In order to foster good instruction and learning, it is important to
reflect on and question our basic assumptions and practices. Grading is
one of the practices, and there is increased, recent interest among
faculty at all levels of education to reflect and question the need for
this practice <span class="citation" data-cites="EQS6XZQN">(Blum &amp;
Kohn, 2020)</span>. This recent attention has led to perhaps more
faculty to move away from grading and toward a multitude of approaches
that are broadly referred to as <em>ungrading</em>. My goal with this
paper is to provide a brief historical overview of grading, highlight
some of the issues raised with grading, especially its impact on
learning and on inclusiveness, and discuss some of the approaches to
ungrading that have been developed and adopted by faculty. In my talk, I
will also address some of what I have learned using ungrading practices
in five distinct undergraduate and graduate courses in two programs.</p>

<h2>BRIEF HISTORY OF GRADING</h2>
<p>According to <span class="citation" data-cites="X7FMWY26">Durm
(1993)</span>, assigning grades to student work, at least in the U.S.,
began in the late 18th century, and may have been motivated by a desire
to standardize and classify student evaluations. Various systems were
first adopted by the Ivy Leagues in the late 19th century. These systems
encompassed percentage, point, and letter-based classifications, and
were the first to mark students as having passed, failed, or somewhere
in between. In 1897, Mount Holyoke appears to be the first college to
apply the letter grade scheme that many of us use today. However, this
type of scheme did not receive widespread attention until the 1940s and
a large proportion of primary, secondary schools, and colleges had not
adopted this system until the 1970s or ’80s <span class="citation"
data-cites="UL7J82EI">(Schinske &amp; Tanner, 2014)</span>.</p>

<h2>APPARENT PURPOSE OF GRADING</h2>
<p>Although the explicit purpose of grading is to provide feedback to
students about their scholastic achievement, there are other systemic
reasons that support the status quo. That is, although adopting grading
schemes may have been driven by a desire to establish a systematic,
reliable method of evaluation, grading standards were also meant to
establish a standardized communication system of evaluation between and
among colleges and universities. <span class="citation"
data-cites="UL7J82EI">Schinske &amp; Tanner (2014)</span> note that
grading may have pedagogical origins and motivations, but it has largely
taken on organizational and bureaucratic purposes.</p>

<h2>CONCERNS WITH GRADING</h2>
<p>Of particular concern with grading, especially with
<em>norm-referenced</em> grading schemes (i.e., grading on a curve), is
that it encourages a belief that grades ought to be normally distributed
based on the natural aptitude of students. These grading schemes thus
attempt to measure inherent ability rather than learning. However, these
assumptions and practices are problematic, and it has long been shown
that effective teaching and better learning strategies can result in
better learning outcomes for all students, regardless of their natural
abilities. In short, it is the responsibility of the instructor to adopt
effective, multiple instructional strategies for the learners in a
classroom <span class="citation" data-cites="4GJMLV6J">(Bloom,
1968)</span>.</p>

<p>Grading schemes also encourage competitive classroom environments and
incentivize students to focus on grades over learning. Cooperative-based
learning environments, rather than competitive or individualistic-based
ones, lead to higher achievement, better retention, increased ability to
apply knowledge and to problem solve <span class="citation"
data-cites="BJIWNH53">(Johnson et al., 1985)</span>. Therefore, an
ungrading approach that provides thorough and qualitative feedback, and
explicit, well designed goals <span class="citation"
data-cites="66L8W643">(Koehler &amp; Meech, 2022)</span>, is more
congruent in cooperative environments.</p>

<p>Furthermore, grades may not effectively produce the desired outcome:
that is, to foster learning. This is especially true when compared to
other types of feedback that emphasize qualitative comments on student
work. <span class="citation" data-cites="R4NRKHU6">Butler &amp; Nisan
(1986)</span> showed that when students receive grades, they tend to
ignore comments, and that students who receive comments alone tend to
outperform students who receive grades or students who receive no
feedback. The results have been corroborated more recently in other
domains <span class="citation" data-cites="USJ29FES">(Bullock et al.,
2021)</span>. Qualitative feedback may also reduce instructional bias,
which is believed to cause grading disparity between under represented
minorities (URM) and non-URM <span class="citation"
data-cites="9JN4YE2D">(Low et al., 2019)</span>.</p>

<h2>UNGRADING APPROACHES</h2>
<p>Ungrading is an umbrella term for multiple approaches to decenter
grades and to center learning through qualitative feedback and increased
student participation in their own assessments. One problem with
ungrading is that instructors are still required to submit grades to
their registrars at the end of a term or semester. Working within such
systems has meant that various faculty have devised strategies for
providing final grades. For example, <span class="citation"
data-cites="I9MMLPE9">Stommel (2020)</span> uses directed and open
student self-evaluation methods and process letters that require
students to reflect on their work, and then asks students to provide
their own final grade based on those reflections and their work.
Peer-evaluation and self-evaluation, especially guided through rubrics
or predefined questions, can also build meta-cognitive skills and offer
tools for self-correction <span class="citation"
data-cites="UL7J82EI">(Schinske &amp; Tanner, 2014)</span>. <span
class="citation" data-cites="KJHKMCAT">Gibbs (2020)</span> uses an
“all-feedback-no-grades” approach. They write that they “call my
approach <em>all-feedback-no-grades</em>, which is to say that I put no
grades on student work; instead, I give my students feedback, lots of
feedback” (p. 92). <span class="citation"
data-cites="9H6ZRVYF">Katopodis &amp; Davidson (2020)</span> start each
term with a contract that outlines the work involved to reach a specific
grade at the end of the semester. In this scenario, students decide how
much work they want to accomplish for the semester to meet the
conditions for a specific letter grade.</p>

<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>
<p>The primary responsibility of the instructor is to foster student
learning. Whether grading or ungrading, it is important to reflect on
our practices and whether those practices match our responsibility. In
this paper, I have presented several types of ungrading practices that
faculty have already adopted. The central argument is that grades may
detract from learning. In my own courses, I have adopted the approach
used by <span class="citation" data-cites="KJHKMCAT">Gibbs
(2020)</span>, the <em>all-feedback-no-grades</em> approach, but with
some differences that are largely dictated by the type of course and by
student level. In my experience, this has led to increased interaction
and discussions with students.</p>
