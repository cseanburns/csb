<h3 id="february-11-2022">February 11, 2022</h3>
<p>I've <em>blogged</em> off and on since blogging was a thing, but it never stuck. I think that was because I've despised every blogging platform that I've ever used. The platform matters for such things. The closest I came to liking a blogging platform was when I used Octopress to log my reading of <em>The Library Quarterly</em>. Octopress was fun to use for a while, but as the posts accumulated, it became annoying to rebuild it every time I added more. So I put all those posts on my wiki and gave up blogging for the <em>nth</em> time.</p>
<p>Even though I didn't stick with blogging because I disliked the available platforms, in my moments of doubt, I wondered if my failure to keep going indicated that I didn't have a voice, or something to say. That really bothered me at times. But of course I have a voice, it was simply that the toolchains and the platforms I used never matched my voice. This toolchain and this platform I've created to post here are my expressions, too. I think that is why I write here about the process of automating this site. It was as important to develop the site to post here as it was to post here for me to keep posting here. Haha!</p>
<p>But even so, I created this page about a year before the March 2020 lockdown, but I only added 16 posts to this page in that first year. In the last two years since lockdown, I've added 140 more, or about 4 posts per month in 2020 and about 7 posts per month in 2021. I don't know what that means. Except to think that, besides the pandemic, other big things happened in those last two years. I don't write about them here. A vast majority of what I put on this page is superficial, I guess. But I think, maybe, it all left me a bit reflective.</p>
