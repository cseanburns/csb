<h1>Research</h1>
<hr>
<h2>Basic Gist</h2>
<p>I work as an associate professor in the <a href="https://ci.uky.edu/sis/">School of Information Science</a> at the University of Kentucky's <a href="https://ci.uky.edu/">College of Communication and Information.</a></p>
<p>In this position, I am presently working on two research projects. The first project is a study of tacit knowledge and open science. In particular, my thesis is that tacit knowing, Michael Polanyi's idea that <q>we can know more than we can tell,</q> challenges the idea that an open science can be fully open. If true, this has ramifications for what we can learn from science done more openly and for what can be replicated based on a more open science.</p>

<p>The second project is a study on document credibility. Here I am interested in what aspects of a document, in particular, news documents and articles, influence how people judge its credibility.</p>

<h2>Recent Publications</h2>

<h2>Research Themes</h2>
<p>The curriculum vitae is a helpful device because it documents (hopefully)
all the work that a scholar achieves. However, it falls short in
contextualizing those achievements. In that vein, I have organized some of my
publications by theme. These themes include bias in peer review, health
information retrieval, reference librarianship and qualitative methodology,
fake news, tacit knowledge and open science, history of automation, and
electronic resources.</p>

more.</p>

<h2>Plain Text Social Science</h2>
<p>I have a <a href="WWW/my-plain-text-social-science.html">Plain Text Way To
Do Plain Text Social Science</a>.</p>

<p>I used the plain text research approach described at the link above to write
a paper for an upcoming conference. It was fun to write, even though the paper
was rejected (2022-05-24), and <a href="WWW/index.html#plain-text-research">I
describe the process on The Text</a>. See the output: <a
href="WWW/ungrading-2022-03-18.html">Ungrade to Learn</a>.</p>

<h1>Teaching</h1>
<hr>

<h2>Undergraduate</h2>

<p>I developed and regularly teach the following two undergraduate courses in
my School's information, communication, and technology (ICT) program.</p>

<dl>
<dt><span class="bold">ICT 418: Linux Systems Administration</span></dt>
<dd>Undergraduate course covering systems administration using the Fedora
GNU/Linux operating system. Topics include Bash scripting, managing users,
installing, securing, and managing services such as MySQL, and more. Lectures
and demo scripts for this course are on GitHub: <a
href="https://github.com/cseanburns/linux_sysadmin">Linux Systems
Administration</a>.</dd>

<dt><span class="bold">ICT 420: Semantic Web Development</span></dt>
<dd>Undergraduate course focused on HTML5, CSS3, JSON-LD, and Git as well as
usability and accessibility. Main software tools: text editor, SFTP, GitHub.
Demo and other material for this course are on GitHub <a
href="https://github.com/cseanburns/webdev">Semantic Web Development</a>.</dd>
</dl>

<h2>Graduate</h2>

<p>I developed and regularly teach the following two graduate courses in my
School's library science (LIS) and information, communication, and technology
(ICT) programs.</p>

<dl>
<dt><span class="bold">LIS 617: Electronic Resource Management</span></dt>
<dd>Graduate course on managing electronic resources for libraries. Topics
covered include the technologies and systems involved, legal issues such as
managing copyright, contract negotiation, and more. Lectures and other material
for this course are on GitHub: <a
href="https://github.com/cseanburns/electronic_resource_mgmt">Electronic
Resource Management</a>.</dd>

<dt><span class="bold">LIS/ICT 658: Knowledge Management</span></dt>
<dd>Graduate course on organizational knowledge management with some emphasis
on disaster and risk management and communication. Although this is an online
course, students are central in selecting specific readings.</dd>
</dl>

<p>I developed and regularly taught the following undergraduate course, but now
teach it mainly when I take on summer teaching.</p>

<dl>
<dt><span class="bold">ICT 201: Personal Knowledge Management</span></dt>
<dd>Undergraduate course on managing personal information and knowledge work flows. I would share my lectures and resources for this course, but I'm working on a major revision and will wait until that revision is complete. Lectures and other materials for this course are on GitHub: <a href="https://github.com/cseanburns/personal_knowledge_mgmt">Personal Knowledge Management</a>.</dd>
</dl>

<h3>Course Books</h3>

<p>I'm in the process of creating books out of my course lectures, notes, and
demonstrations using the <a
href="https://rust-lang.github.io/mdBook/index.html">mdbooks</a> software.
I should have a total of five books for each of the courses listed above.</p>

<p>This is still a work in progress. The first two books cover my electronic
resource management class and my Linux systems administration class. I don't
expect either to be polished until around December 2022. However, I have made
the rough drafts available below. I have completed the personal knowledge management draft, but it may still need some polishing.</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="WWW/ERM-book/index.html">Electronic Resource Management in Libraries</a></li>
  <li><a href="WWW/linux-systems-admin/index.html">Linux Systems Administration</a></li>
  <li><a href="WWW/pkm/index.html">Personal Knowledge Management</a></li>
</ul>
