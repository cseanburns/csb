<h1>Research</h1>
<hr>
<h2>Basic Gist</h2>
<p>I work as an associate professor in the <a href="https://ci.uky.edu/sis/">School of Information Science</a> at the University of Kentucky's <a href="https://ci.uky.edu/">College of Communication and Information.</a></p>
<p>In this position, I am presently working on two research projects. The first project is a study of tacit knowledge and open science. In particular, my thesis is that tacit knowing, Michael Polanyi's idea that <q>we can know more than we can tell,</q> challenges the idea that an open science can be fully open. If true, this has ramifications for what we can learn from science done more openly and for what can be replicated based on a more open science.</p>

<p>The second project is a study on document credibility. Here I am interested in what aspects of a document, in particular, news documents and articles, influence how people judge its credibility.</p>

<h2>Recent Publications</h2>

<h2>Research Themes</h2>
<p>My CV (link above) is comprehensive, but I have organized some of my
publications by theme. These themes include bias in peer review, health
information retrieval, reference librarianship and qualitative methodology,
fake news, tacit knowledge and open science, history of automation, and
electronic resources.</p>

<h2>Plain Text Social Science</h2>
<p>I have a <a href="WWW/my-plain-text-social-science.html">Plain Text Way To
Do Plain Text Social Science</a>.</p>

<p>I used the plain text research approach described at the link above to write
a paper for an upcoming conference. It was fun, and <a
href="WWW/index.html#plain-text-research">I describe the process on The
Text</a>. See the output: <a href="WWW/ungrading-2022-03-18.html">Ungrade to

<h1>Teaching</h1>
<hr>

<h2>Undergraduate</h2>

<p>I regularly teach the following two undergraduate courses in my School's information, communication, and technology (ICT) program.</p>

<dl>
<dt><span class="bold">ICT 418: Linux Systems Administration</span></dt>
<dd>Undergraduate course covering systems administration using the Fedora GNU/Linux operating system. Topics include Bash scripting, managing users, installing, securing, and managing services such as MySQL, and more. Lectures and demo scripts for this course are on GitHub: <a href="https://github.com/cseanburns/linux_sysadmin">Linux Systems Administration</a>.</dd>

<dt><span class="bold">ICT 420: Semantic Web Development</span></dt>
<dd>Undergraduate course focused on HTML5, CSS3, JSON-LD, and Git as well as usability and accessibility. Main software tools: text editor, SFTP, GitHub. Demo and other material for this course are on GitHub <a href="https://github.com/cseanburns/webdev">Semantic Web Development</a>.</dd>
</dl>

<h2>Graduate</h2>

<p>I regularly teach the following two graduate courses in my School's library science (LIS) and information, communication, and technology (ICT) programs.</p>

<dl>
<dt><span class="bold">LIS 617: Electronic Resource Management</span></dt>
<dd>Graduate course on managing electronic resources for libraries. Topics covered include the technologies and systems involved, legal issues such as managing copyright, contract negotiation, and more. Lectures and other material for this course are on GitHub: <a href="https://github.com/cseanburns/electronic_resource_mgmt">Electronic Resource Management</a>.</dd>

<dt><span class="bold">LIS/ICT 658: Knowledge Management</span></dt>
<dd>Graduate course on organizational knowledge management with some emphasis on disaster and risk management and communication. Although this is an online course, students are central in selecting specific readings.</dd>
</dl>

<p>I regularly taught the following undergraduate course, but now teach it mainly when I take on summer teaching.</p>

<dl>
<dt><span class="bold">ICT 201: Personal Knowledge Management</span></dt>
<dd>Undergraduate course on managing personal information and knowledge work flows. I would share my lectures and resources for this course, but I'm working on a major revision and will wait until that revision is complete. Lectures and other materials for this course are on GitHub: <a href="https://github.com/cseanburns/personal_knowledge_mgmt">Personal Knowledge Management</a>.</dd>
</dl>

<h3>Course Books</h3>

<p>I'm in the process of creating books out of my course lectures, notes, and demonstrations using the <a href="https://rust-lang.github.io/mdBook/index.html">mdbooks</a> software. I should have a total of five books for each of the courses listed above.</p>

<p>This is still a work in progress. The first two books cover my electronic resource management class and my Linux systems administration class. I don't expect either to be polished until around December 2022. However, I have made the rough drafts available:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="WWW/ERM-book/index.html">Electronic Resource Management in Libraries</a></li>
  <li><a href="WWW/linux-systems-admin/index.html">Linux Systems Administration</a></li>
</ul>

<h1>Miscellany</h1>
<hr>

<h2>Systems Administration</h2>
<p>I maintain two Linux servers for colleagues and students at my School to support class activities. I use one dedicated server to host WordPress and Omeka installations that support the library science and the information and communication technologies (ICT) programs. I use a separate virtual machine on a hosting service to provide shell and MySQL accounts to support several courses in our undergraduate ICT program.</p>

<h2>Statistics Notes</h2>
<p>There are better and more complete tutorials on the web, and <a href="https://www.r-project.org/other-docs.html">the R documentation</a> is great, but I do keep some basic notes on using R for statistics on my wiki. Some of these notes are based on introductory presentations I've given on R, but some were written as refreshers if I needed them. Or, one way I learned how to use R is by replicating, in R, lessons from statistics textbooks that used other software packages. Some of the notes below are based on that process.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="wiki/r/introduction-to-r">Brief introduction to R</a></li>
<li><a href="wiki/r/plotting-in-r">Basic plotting in R</a></li>
<li><a href="wiki/r/chi-square">Chi-square in R</a></li>
<li><a href="wiki/r/anova">ANOVA in R</a></li>
<li><a href="wiki/r/manova">MANOVA in R</a></li>
<li><a href="wiki/r/linear-regression">Linear regression in R</a></li>
<li><a href="wiki/r/multiple-regression">Multiple regression in R</a></li>
<li><a href="wiki/r/logistic-regression">Logistic regression in R</a></li>
<li><a href="wiki/r/intraclass-correlation">Intraclass correlation in R</a></li>
</ul>

<h2>Random Essay and Note Topics</h2>
<p>My <a href="wiki/">wiki</a> contains various kinds of content. I've tried blogging over the years, but <a href="WWW/index.html#posting-here">it never really took</a>. But before deleting those blogging sites, I preserved the posts on my wiki. I also use the wiki to keep notes and how-tos (like the statistics how-tos listed above). I'm using GitHub more for these things lately, but I still add to the wiki.</p>
<p>These former blog posts are now simply essays on my wiki:</p>

<h2>Automating this Website</h2>
<p>I wrote a handful of weird scripts to automate site publishing and deploying to <a href="WWW/index.html">The Text</a>, which is a single page of mostly short posts on a range of topics: <a href="WWW/automation.html">Site Automation w/ Scripts</a>.</p>
