  <p>I am an assistant professor of information science at the University of
  Kentucky. My research and publications focus on scholarly communication and
  systems, the history of library science, qualitative methodology, and
  academic libraries.</p>
  
  <p>Below are some recent updates about and some basic descriptions of my
  professional work. My <a href="wiki/cv">CV</a> provides more details and
  includes links to publications (and to open access versions, when
  possible).</p>

    <h2>Research Updates</h2>
    
    <p>I am working on an information retrieval project related to
    bibliographic and abstracting/indexing databases. Other recent activities
    include:</p>
    
    <p>Robert Shapiro, Tyler Nix, Jeff Huber and I had a talk accepted by the
    upcoming Medical Library Association conference. The title of the talk is
    <em>Variation and Outliers in Search Results among MEDLINE-based Databases:
    A Longitudinal Study</em>. The project is part of the MEDLINE research
  project mentioned below.</p>
    
    <p>Robert Shapiro, Tyler Nix, Jeff Huber and I had a poster accepted at the
    2019 iConference. The project examines discrepancies among MEDLINE
    databases. The title of the poster is <em>Which MEDLINE? Outlier Search
    Results are Normal among MEDLINE Databases</em>.</p>
    
    <p>I am co-leading a workshop at the 2019 iConference with Marie Radford,
    Vanessa Kitzie, Diana Floegel, Lynn Silipigni Connaway, and Jenny
      Bossaller. The title of the workshop is <em>InVivo Inspiration:
        Investigating Computer Assisted Qualitative Data Analysis Software
        (CAQDAS)</em>. I will be discussing <a
                           href="http://rqda.r-forge.r-project.org/">RQDA</a>,
                         the qualitatative data analysis software that is part
                         of the R programming ecosystem.</p>
