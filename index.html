<section>
  <h1>Sean Burns</h1>

  <p>I work as an Associate Professor
  at the University of Kentucky's
  College of Communication and Information, within
  <a href="https://ci.uky.edu/sis/about/our-school">the School of Information Science</a>.</p>

  <p>My
  <a href="WWW/about.html">About page</a>
  contains more details.</p>

</section>

<section id="research">
    <h2>Research</h2>

    <p>My research topics broadly cover areas in scholarly communication,
    open science, open access, information retrieval, and academic libraries.</p>

    <p>See my
    <a href="WWW/research.html">research summary page</a>
    or my
    <a href="WWW/cv.html">CV</a>.

</section>

<section id="teaching">
    <h2>Teaching</h2>

    <p>I teach in the
    <a href="https://ci.uky.edu/sis/academics/library-science">Library Science (LS)</a>
    graduate program and the
    <a href="https://ci.uky.edu/sis/academics/information-communication-technology">Information, Communication, Technology (ICT)</a>
    undergraduate and graduate programs.</p>

    <h3>Books</h3>

    <p>I've written and made available several of my
    <a href="WWW/books.html">textbooks</a>
    for the courses that I teach.</p>

    <h3>Software</h3>

    <p>I teach a couple of courses
    that involve using the Bash shell on Linux.
    I wrote several open source
    <a href="WWW/software.html">software applications</a>
    to help students learn how
    to use Linux command line utitilies and
    to navigate the Linux filesystem.</p>

<section id="the_text">
    <h2>The Text</h2>

    <p><a href="WWW/index.html">The Text</a>
    is a single page that contains
    hundreds of short posts on a variety of topics.
    I started the page on April 23, 2019,
    and have been adding to it ever since.</p>

    <p>Why is it a single page?
    It's a single page because a single,
    long page on random topics really
    confuses search engines,
    which I think is funny
    (because I know why it confuses them).</p>

    <p>To add new posts to the page,
    I write a single markdown file,
    and then process that file with a
    <a href="https://github.com/cseanburns/csb/blob/master/scripts/post">bash</a> script,
    which converts it to HTML,
    adds a bunch of extra tags,
    creates a RSS entry,
    etc, etc.
    The script uses a lot of sed and
    <a href="https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/utilities/ed.html">ed</a> commands,
    which I also think is funny.</p>

<section id="bookshelf">
    <h2>Bookshelf</h2>

    <p>Reading books is important.
    Here's
    <a href="WWW/bookshelf.html">my virtual bookshelf</a>.</p>

<section id="notes">
  <h2>Notes</h2>

    <p>I've been keeping some 
    <a href="NOTES/index.html">Notes</a>.</p>
