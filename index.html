<p>Below are some recent updates about and some basic descriptions of my
professional work. My <a href="wiki/cv">CV</a> provides more details and
includes links to publications (and to open access versions, when
possible).</p>

<h2>Research Updates</h2>

<p>I am working on an information retrieval project related to bibliographic 
and abstracting/indexing databases. Other recent activities include:</p>

<ul>

  <li>Robert Shapiro, Tyler Nix, Jeff Huber and I had a talk accepted by the
    upcoming Medical Library Association conference. The title of the talk is
    <em>Variation and Outliers in Search Results among MEDLINE-based Databases:
    A Longitudinal Study</em>. The project is part of the MEDLINE research
  project mentioned below.</li>

  <li>Robert Shapiro, Tyler Nix, Jeff Huber and I had a poster accepted at the
    2019 iConference. The project examines discrepancies among MEDLINE
    databases. The title of the poster is <em>Which MEDLINE? Outlier Search
      Results are Normal among MEDLINE Databases</em>.</li>

  <li>I am co-leading a workshop at the 2019 iConference with Marie Radford,
    Vanessa Kitzie, Diana Floegel, Lynn Silipigni Connaway, and Jenny
    Bossaller. The title of the workshop is <em>InVivo Inspiration:
      Investigating Computer Assisted Qualitative Data Analysis Software
      (CAQDAS)</em>. I will be discussing <a
  href="http://rqda.r-forge.r-project.org/">RQDA</a>, the qualitatative data
analysis software that is part of the R programming ecosystem.</li>

</ul>
