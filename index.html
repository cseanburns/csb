                    <h1>C. Sean Burns</h1>
		    <p>This is a personal website in the spirit of a <em>digital garden</em>.
		    It contains pages about niche things like plain text, reading, writing, coding,
		    computer systems (and their history), research projects, teaching, education, cooking,
		    family, and my attempts to pay attention to the details.</p>

		    <p>This site is built for browsing and exploring.
		    New pages and edits happen quietly.
		    Writing is provisional.</p>

		    <p>The site is perfectly usable in a text-mode browser, such as
		    <a href="https://w3m.sourceforge.net/">w3m</a>,
		    <a href="https://github.com/rkd77/elinks">Elinks</a>,
		    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text-based_web_browser">and more</a>.</p>

		    <p>My <a href="WWW/about.html">About page</a> contains some details.</p>

		    <h2>Now</h2>

		    <ul>
			    <li>Currently reading:
				    <cite class="title">Sophie's Choice</cite> / <span class="author">William Styron</span>.</li>
			    <li>Mood: Good. We're between semesters, and it's time to take a breath.</li>
			    <li>Learning: Playing around with substring expansion and other capabilities in and with <code>bash</code>.</li>
			    <li>Researching: Working on a project about librarian publishing patterns.</li>
			    <li>Academic reading: Diving back into domain analysis theory and reading a lot of Birger Hjørland's works.</li>
		    </ul>

		    <p>I'm an academic, but most of this site does not abide by the usual academic genres.</p>

			<h2>Personal Content</h2>

			It includes an RSS feed.</p>

			<h3>Notes</h3>

			<p>I've been keeping some <a href="NOTES/index.html">Notes</a>.</p>

			<h3>Reading</h3>

			<p>Reading books is important.
			Here's <a href="WWW/bookshelf.html">my virtual bookshelf</a>.</p>
