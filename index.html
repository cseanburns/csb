                    <h1>C. Sean Burns</h1>

					<p>This is a personal website in the spirit of a <em>digital garden</em>. It contains pages
					about niche things like plain text, reading, writing, coding, computer systems (and their history),
					research projects, teaching, education, cooking, family, and paying attention to the details
					with my limited senses.</p>

                    <p>My <a href="WWW/about.html">About page</a> contains some details.</p>

					<h2>Now</h2>

					<ul>
						<li>Personal reading: I'm reading
							<cite class="title">The Magic of Code: How Digital Language Created and Connected Our World&mdash;and Shapes Our Future</cite> / <span class="author">Samuel Arbesman</span>.</li>
						<li>Learning: Playing around with substring expansion and other capabilities in and with <code>bash</code>.</li>
						<li>Researching: Working on a project about librarian publishing patterns.</li>
						<li>Academic reading: Diving back into domain analysis theory and reading a lot of Birger Hjørland's works.</li>
					</ul>

                <section id="the_text">
                    <h2>The Text</h2>

                    <p><a href="WWW/index.html">The Text</a> is probably the main page of this site.
					It's a single page that contains hundreds of short posts on a variety of topics.
                    I started the page on April 23, 2019 and have been adding to it ever since.</p>

                    <p>Why is it a single page?
                    It's a single page because a single, long page on random topics confuses search engines.
                    I think that's funny because it shows that search engines have an inherent definition of what a document is,
					and a single, long page messes with that definition.</p>

                    <p>To add new posts to the page, I write a single markdown file, and then process that file with a
                    <a href="https://github.com/cseanburns/csb/blob/master/scripts/post">bash</a> script,
                    which converts it to HTML, adds a bunch of extra tags, inserts into The Text page,
					creates a RSS entry, etc, etc.
                    The script uses a lot of <code>sed</code> and
                    <a href="https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9799919799/utilities/ed.html"><code>ed</code></a> commands,
                    which I also think is funny.</p>
                </section>

                <section id="research">
                    <h2>Research</h2>

                    <p>My research topics broadly cover areas in scholarly communication, open science, open access, information retrieval,
                    and academic libraries.</p>

                    <p>See my <a href="WWW/research.html">research summary page</a> or my <a href="WWW/cv.html">CV</a>.
                </section>

                <section id="teaching">
                    <h2>Teaching</h2>

                    <p>I teach in Library Science (LS) and in Information, Communication, Technology (ICT) programs.</p>

                    <h3>Books</h3>

                    <p>I've written and made available open educational / open access textbooks for the courses that I teach.
                    These textbooks cover systems librarianship, electronic resource management, Linux systems administration,
                    personal knowledge management, and semantic web development.</p>

                    <p>Visit <a href="WWW/books.html">textbooks</a> for the complete list.</p>

                    <h3>Software</h3>

                    <p>I teach a couple of courses that involve using the Bash shell on Linux.
                    To facilitate that, I wrote several open source software applications to help students learn
                    how to use Linux command line utitilies and to navigate the Linux filesystem.</p>

                    <p>Visit <a href="WWW/software.html">software applications</a> to download and use them.</p>

					<p>These applications were all written in <code>bash</code>, but they employ a lot of additional utilities.
					I'm learning more <code>bash</code> to make them more bashy.</p>
