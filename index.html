<h1>Research</h1>

<h2>Basic Gist</h2>
<p>I work as an associate professor in the <a href="https://ci.uky.edu/sis/">School of Information Science</a> at the University of Kentucky's <a href="https://ci.uky.edu/">College of Communication and Information.</a></p>
<p>In this position, I am presently working on two research projects. The first project is a study of tacit knowledge and open science. In particular, my thesis is that tacit knowing, Michael Polanyi's idea that <q>we can know more than we can tell,</q> challenges the idea that an open science can be fully open. If true, this has ramifications for what we can learn from science done more openly and for what can be replicated based on a more open science.</p>

<p>The second project is a study on document credibility. Here I am interested in what aspects of a document, in particular, news documents and articles, influence how people judge its credibility.</p>

<h2>Research Themes</h2>
<p>The curriculum vitae is a helpful device because it documents (hopefully)
all the work that a scholar achieves. However, it falls short in
contextualizing those achievements. In that vein, I have organized some of my
publications by theme. These themes include bias in peer review, health
information retrieval, reference librarianship and qualitative methodology,
fake news, tacit knowledge and open science, history of automation, and
electronic resources.</p>

<p>Visit my <a href="WWW/research.html">selected research</a> page to learn
more.</p>

<h2>Plain Text Social Science</h2>
<p>I have a <a href="WWW/my-plain-text-social-science.html">Plain Text Way To
Do Plain Text Social Science</a>.</p>

<p>I used the plain text research approach described at the link above to write
a paper for an upcoming conference. It was fun to write, even though the paper
was rejected (2022-05-24), and <a href="WWW/index.html#plain-text-research">I
describe the process on The Text</a>. See the output: <a
href="WWW/ungrading-2022-03-18.html">Ungrade to Learn</a>.</p>

<h2>Course Books</h2>

<p>I wrote the following two books for courses in my program. These works are
based on lectures and demonstrations that I had created for these courses.
Although I no longer regularly teach <i>Personal Knowledge Management</i> (it's
in good hands, though), I created the course and have long desired to write
a cohesive work for this course.</p>

<p>I consider these works to be live documents. They will be regularly revised for clarity and updated, especially during the months before and while they are taught, to include new content.</p>

<p>Burns, C. S. (2022). <i>Linux systems administration</i>.

<p>Burns, C. S. (2022). <i>Personal knowledge management handbook</i>. <a href="https://cseanburns.net/WWW/pkm/">https://cseanburns.net/WWW/pkm/</a>.

<p>The following book on <i>Electronic Resource Management</i> is a work in
progress, but I am teaching this course during the Fall 2022 semester and plan
to complete the final version as I teach the course.</p>

<dd>Undergraduate course covering systems administration using the Fedora
GNU/Linux operating system. Topics include Bash scripting, managing users,
installing, securing, and managing services such as MySQL, and more. Lectures
and demo scripts for this course are on GitHub: <a
href="https://github.com/cseanburns/linux_sysadmin">Linux Systems
Administration</a>.</dd>

<dt><span class="bold">ICT 420: Semantic Web Development</span></dt>
<dd>Undergraduate course focused on HTML5, CSS3, JSON-LD, and Git as well as
usability and accessibility. Main software tools: text editor, SFTP, GitHub.
Demo and other material for this course are on GitHub <a
href="https://github.com/cseanburns/webdev">Semantic Web Development</a>.</dd>
</dl>

<h2>Graduate</h2>

<p>I developed and regularly teach the following two graduate courses in my
School's library science (LIS) and information, communication, and technology
(ICT) programs.</p>

<dl>
<dt><span class="bold">LIS 617: Electronic Resource Management</span></dt>
<dd>Graduate course on managing electronic resources for libraries. Topics
covered include the technologies and systems involved, legal issues such as
managing copyright, contract negotiation, and more. Lectures and other material
for this course are on GitHub: <a
href="https://github.com/cseanburns/electronic_resource_mgmt">Electronic
Resource Management</a>.</dd>

<dt><span class="bold">LIS/ICT 658: Knowledge Management</span></dt>
<dd>Graduate course on organizational knowledge management with some emphasis
on disaster and risk management and communication. Although this is an online
course, students are central in selecting specific readings.</dd>
</dl>

<p>I developed and regularly taught the following undergraduate course, but now
teach it mainly when I take on summer teaching.</p>

<dl>
<dt><span class="bold">ICT 201: Personal Knowledge Management</span></dt>
<dd>Undergraduate course on managing personal information and knowledge work flows. I would share my lectures and resources for this course, but I'm working on a major revision and will wait until that revision is complete. Lectures and other materials for this course are on GitHub: <a href="https://github.com/cseanburns/personal_knowledge_mgmt">Personal Knowledge Management</a>.</dd>
