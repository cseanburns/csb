    <h1>Sean Burns, PhD</h1>
    <h2>Basic Gist</h2>
  </hgroup>

  <p>Welcome to my personal website.
  I work as as an associate professor in the
  <a href="https://ci.uky.edu/sis/">School of Information Science</a>
  at the University of Kentucky's
  <a href="https://ci.uky.edu/">College of Communication and Information.</a>
  In this role,
  I teach in the library science graduate program and
  in the information, communication, and technology
  undergraduate and graduate programs.</p>
</section>

<div class="container">

<section class="first">
  <h2>Research</h2>

  <p>I am presently working on three research projects. The first project is a
  study of tacit knowledge and open science. In particular, my thesis is that
  tacit knowing, Michael Polanyi's idea that <q>we can know more than we can
  tell,</q> challenges the idea that an open science can be fully open. If
  true, this has ramifications for what we can learn from science done more
  openly and for what can be replicated based on a more open science.</p>

  <p>The second project is a study on document credibility. Here I am interested
  in what aspects of a document, in particular, news documents and articles,
  influence how people judge its credibility.</p>

  <p>The third project is about article titles.
  More details later.</p>

  <h3>Research Themes</h3>

  <p>The curriculum vitae is a helpful device because it documents (hopefully)
  all the work that a scholar achieves. However, it falls short in
  contextualizing those achievements. In that vein, I have organized some of my
  publications by theme. These themes include bias in peer review, health
  information retrieval, reference librarianship and qualitative methodology,
  fake news, tacit knowledge and open science, history of automation, and
  electronic resources.</p>

  <p>Visit my <a href="WWW/research.html">selected research</a> page to learn
  more.</p>

  <h3>Plain Text Social Science</h3>

  <p>I enjoy a <a href="WWW/my-plain-text-social-science.html">Plain Text Way
    To Do Plain Text Social Science</a>.</p>

  <p>I used the plain text research approach described at the link above to write
  a paper for an upcoming conference. It was fun to write, even though the paper
  was rejected (2022-05-24), and
  <a href="WWW/index.html#plain-text-research">I describe the process on The Text</a>.
  See the output:
  <a href="WWW/ungrading-2022-03-18.html">Ungrade to Learn</a>.</p>

  <h2>Software</h2>

  <p>Most of the coding I do is for analyzing data
  for my research projects. However, I built several programs
  to help introduce my students to the Linux command line.
  These are useful if you're running Linux or
  have access to a Linux machine and the Bash shell.</p>

  <ul>
    <li><code>learn-the-cli</code> is an interactive Bash
      script that walks users through a set of common commands
      and lets them practice the commands.</li>
    <li><code>learn-the-filesystem</code> is an interactive
      Bash Script that builds off the <code>learn-the-cli</code>
      script but focuses on navigating the Linux directory
      tree and learning the differences between absolute and
      relative paths.</li>
    <li><code>flashcards</code> is a modified shell script that
      helps users memorize a set of common commands. This comes
      with a <code>cards.csv</code> file containing the data for
      the script.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Instructions for downloading and using the scripts above
  are on the GitHub repo:

  <h2>Teaching</h2>

  <h3>Course Books</h3>

  <p>I wrote the following three books for courses in my program. These works
  are based on lectures and demonstrations that I had created for these
  courses. Although I no longer regularly teach <i>Personal Knowledge
  Management</i> (it's in good hands, though), I created the course and long
  desired to write a cohesive work for it.</p>

  <p>I consider these works to be live documents. They will be regularly revised
  for clarity and updated, especially during the months before and while they are
  taught, to include new content.</p>

  <p>Burns, C. S. (2022). <i>Linux systems administration</i>. 
  <a href="https://cseanburns.net/WWW/linux-systems-admin/">https://cseanburns.net/WWW/linux-systems-admin/</a>.</p>

  <p>Burns, C. S. (2022). <i>Personal knowledge management handbook</i>. <a href="https://cseanburns.net/WWW/pkm/">https://cseanburns.net/WWW/pkm/</a>.

  <p>Burns, C. S. (2022). <i>Electronic resource management</i>. <a
  href="https://cseanburns.net/WWW/ERM-book/">https://cseanburns.net/WWW/ERM-book</a></p>

  <p>As of spring 2023, I'm teaching a new course on systems librarianship.
  I'm writing a book for this course, too. It will not be complete until
  later in the spring semester.
  However, I include it here for those that may want to follow along:</p>

  <h3>Undergraduate</h3>

  <p>I developed and regularly teach the following two undergraduate courses in
  my School's information, communication, and technology (ICT) program.</p>

  <dl>
    <dt><span class="bold">ICT 418: Linux Systems Administration</span></dt>
    <dd>Undergraduate course covering systems administration using the Ubuntu 
      Linux distribution. Topics include Bash scripting, managing users,
      installing, securing, and managing services such as MySQL, and more. Lectures
      and demo scripts for this course are on GitHub: <a
      href="https://github.com/cseanburns/linux_sysadmin">Linux Systems
      Administration</a>.</dd>

    <dt><span class="bold">ICT 420: Semantic Web Development</span></dt>
    <dd>Undergraduate course focused on HTML5, CSS3, JSON-LD, and Git as well as
        usability and accessibility. Main software tools: text editor, SFTP, GitHub.
        Demo and other material for this course are on GitHub
        <a href="https://github.com/cseanburns/webdev">Semantic Web Development</a>.</dd>
  </dl>

  <h3>Graduate</h3>

  <p>I developed and regularly teach the following two graduate courses in my
  School's library science (LIS) and information, communication, and technology
  (ICT) programs.</p>

  <dl>
    <dt><span class="bold">LIS 617: Electronic Resource Management</span></dt>
    <dd>Graduate course on managing electronic resources for libraries. Topics
    covered include the technologies and systems involved, legal issues such as
    managing copyright, contract negotiation, and more. Lectures and other material
    for this course are on GitHub:
    <a href="https://github.com/cseanburns/electronic_resource_mgmt">Electronic
    Resource Management</a>.</dd>
  </dl>

  <p>As of Spring 2023, I will be teaching a new course on system's
  librarianship, which means someone else will take over the knowledge
  management course that I have taught since spring 2014.</p>

  <dl>
    <dt><span class="bold">LIS/ICT 658: Knowledge Management</span></dt>
    <dd>Graduate course on organizational knowledge management with some emphasis
    on disaster and risk management and communication. Although this is an online
    course, students are central in selecting specific readings.</dd>
  </dl>

  <p>I developed and regularly taught the following undergraduate course, but
  now teach it mainly when I take on summer teaching.</p>

  <dl>
    <dt><span class="bold">ICT 201: Personal Knowledge Management</span></dt>
    <dd>Undergraduate course on managing personal information and knowledge work
    flows. I would share my lectures and resources for this course, but I'm working
    on a major revision and will wait until that revision is complete. Lectures and
    other materials for this course are on GitHub:
    <a href="https://github.com/cseanburns/personal_knowledge_mgmt">Personal Knowledge
    Management</a>.</dd>
