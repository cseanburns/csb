  <h1>Sean Burns, PhD</h1>
  <h2>Basic Gist</h2>

  <p>Welcome to my personal website.
  I am an Associate Professor at the
  University of Kentucky's College of Communication and Information,
  within the School of Information Science.
  I teach in the <em>library science</em> graduate program and
  the <em>information, communication, technology</em> undergraduate
  and graduate programs.
  My research topics broadly cover areas in
  scholarly communication, information science, and academic libraries.
  See below for more details.</p>
</section>

<main>

<section>
  <h2>Research</h2>

  <h3>Current Projects</h3>

  <p>I am presently working on three research projects. The first project is a
  study of tacit knowledge and open science. In particular, my thesis is that
  tacit knowing, Michael Polanyi's idea that <q>we can know more than we can
  tell,</q> challenges the idea that an open science can be fully open. If
  true, this has ramifications for what we can learn from science done more
  openly and for what can be replicated based on a more open science.</p>

  <p>The second project is a study on document credibility. Here I am interested
  in what aspects of a document, in particular, news documents and articles,
  influence how people judge its credibility.</p>

  <p>The third project is about article titles.
  More details later.</p>

  <h3>Research Themes</h3>

  <p>The curriculum vitae serves as a valuable tool
  for recording a scholar's accomplishments.
  However, it may lack the some necessary context.
  To address this,
  I have categorized my publications by theme.
  These themes encompass bias in peer review,
  health information retrieval,
  reference librarianship,
  misinformation,
  tacit knowledge in conjunction with open science,
  the historical development of automation,
  and electronic resources.</p>

  <p>Visit my <a href="WWW/research.html">selected research</a> page to learn
  more.</p>

  <h3>Plain Text Social Science</h3>

  <p>I enjoy a <a href="WWW/my-plain-text-social-science.html">Plain Text Way
    To Do Plain Text Social Science</a>.</p>

  <p>I used the plain text research approach described at the link above to write
  a paper for an upcoming conference. It was fun to write, even though the paper
  was rejected (2022-05-24), and
  <a href="WWW/index.html#plain-text-research">I describe the process on The Text</a>.
  See the output:
  <a href="WWW/ungrading-2022-03-18.html">Ungrade to Learn</a>.</p>

  <h2>Software</h2>

  <p>Most of the coding I do is for analyzing data
  for my research projects. However, I built several programs
  to help introduce my students to the Linux command line.
  These are useful if you're running Linux or
  have access to a Linux machine and the Bash shell.</p>

  <ul>
    <li><code>learn-the-cli</code> is an interactive Bash
      script that walks users through a set of common commands
      and lets them practice the commands.</li>
    <li><code>learn-the-filesystem</code> is an interactive
      Bash Script that builds off the <code>learn-the-cli</code>
      script but focuses on navigating the Linux directory
      tree and learning the differences between absolute and
      relative paths.</li>
    <li><code>flashcards</code> is a modified shell script that
      helps users memorize a set of common commands. This comes
      with a <code>cards.csv</code> file containing the data for
      the script.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Instructions for downloading and using the scripts above
  are on the GitHub repo:

  <h2>Teaching</h2>

  <h3>Course Books</h3>

  <p>I have written four books tailored
  to courses within my program,
  drawing inspiration from lectures and demonstrations
  I developed for these classes.
  These books cover
  <i>Linux Systems Administration</i>,
  <i>Electronic Resource Management</i>,
  <i>Systems Librarianship</i>, and
  <i>Personal Knowledge Management (PKM)</i>.
  I make them publicly available for others to use
  and build upon.</p>

  <p>I view these works as living documents,
  subject to ongoing revisions to improve clarity and
  reflect new knowledge and technological developments.
  This is particularly true during the periods
  leading up to and during the courses when new content is integrated.</p>

  <ul>
    <li><a href="https://cseanburns.net/WWW/linux-systems-admin/"><i>Linux
          systems administration</i> (2022)</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://cseanburns.net/WWW/pkm/"><i>Personal knowledge
        management</i> (2022) </a></li>
    <li><a href="https://cseanburns.net/WWW/ERM-book/"><i>Electronic resource
          management</i> (2022)</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://cseanburns.net/WWW/systems-librarianship"><i>Systems
          librarianship</i> (2023)</a></li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Undergraduate</h3>

  <p>I developed and regularly teach the following two undergraduate courses in
  my School's information, communication, and technology (ICT) program.</p>

  <dl>
    <dt><span class="bold">ICT 201: Personal Knowledge Management</span></dt>
    <dd>Undergraduate course on managing personal information and knowledge
      work flows. Lectures and other materials for this course are on GitHub:
    <a href="https://github.com/cseanburns/personal_knowledge_mgmt">Personal Knowledge
    Management</a>.</dd>
  </dl>

  <h3>Graduate</h3>

  <p>I developed and regularly teach the following two graduate courses in my
  School's library science (LIS) and information, communication, and technology
  (ICT) programs.</p>
