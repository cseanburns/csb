<p>Below you will find some recent updates about and basic descriptions of my 
  professional work. For more details and links to my publications (and to open 
  access versions, when possible), see my <a href="wiki/cv">CV</a>.</p>

<section>

<h2>Research Updates</h2>

<p>I am working on an information retrieval project related to bibliographic 
and abstracting/indexing databases. Other recent activities include:</p>

<ul>

  <li>Robert Shapiro, Tyler Nix, Jeff Huber and I had a talk accepted by the
    upcoming Medical Library Association conference. The title of the talk is
    <em>Variation and Outliers in Search Results among MEDLINE-based Databases:
    A Longitudinal Study</em>. The project is part of the MEDLINE research
  project mentioned below.</li>

  <li>Robert Shapiro, Tyler Nix, Jeff Huber and I had a poster accepted at the
    2019 iConference. The project examines discrepancies among MEDLINE
    databases. The title of the poster is <em>Which MEDLINE? Outlier Search
      Results are Normal among MEDLINE Databases</em>.</li>

  <li>I am excited to participate in creating a workshop at the 2019
    iConference with Marie Radford, Vanessa Kitzie, Diana Floegel, Lynn
    Silipigni Connaway, and Jenny Bossaller. The title of the workshop is
    <em>InVivo Inspiration: Investigating Computer Assisted Qualitative Data
      Analysis Software (CAQDAS)</em>.</li>

  <li><a href="http://www.uky.edu/~cfox/">Chuck Fox</a> and I concluded our 
    three year project, and our fifth paper together, on bias in peer review 
    with a <a href="http://doi.org/10.1007/s11192-017-2517-5">publication</a> 
    in <em>Scientometrics</em>. Our previous work on peer review largely 
  focused on gender bias, but this work focused on language, geography, and 
  socioeconomics.</li>

  <li><a href="http://www.jennybossaller.com/">Jenny Bossaller</a>, <a 
         href="http://www.amyvanscoy.net/">Amy VanScoy</a>, and I published <a 
         href="http://doi.org/10.1108/JD-03-2016-0028">some work</a> using 
       qualitative secondary analysis as a methodology. This can be found in 
       the <em>Journal of Documentation</em>.</li>

  <li>Chuck Fox, Anna Muncy, Jennifer Meyer, and I published our <a 
         href="http://doi.org/10.1111/1365-2435.12665">third paper</a> on 
       gender bias in peer review. This one related to author suggested 
       reviewers. The paper was published in <em>Functional Ecology</em>.</li>
    
</ul>
