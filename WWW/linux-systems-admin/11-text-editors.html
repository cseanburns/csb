<p>Working on the command line means, well, writing a lot of commands.
But there will be times when we will want to save some of the commands
that we write in order to re-use them later, or we might want to
develop the commands into a script (i.e., program) because we might
want to automate a process. The shell is great for writing one off commands,
but it's not a great place to write multi-line commands.
Plus, the shell that we are working with is called <code>bash</code>,
and <code>bash</code> is a full-fledged programming language.
That means that when you are writing a simple command,
like <code>cd public_html</code>,
you are programming.
So it makes sense that the more programming that we do,
the better we'll get at it,
and the more we'll need more sophisticated environments
to help manage our programs.</p>
<p>As we learn more about how to do systems administration with Linux,
we'll also need to edit configuration files.
These kinds of files exist primarily in the <code>/etc</code> directory.
For example, later in the semester we will install the
<a href="https://httpd.apache.org/">Apache Web Server</a>,
and we will need to edit Apache's configuration files in the process.
We could do this using some of the tools that we've already covered,
like <code>sed</code> and <code>awk</code>,
but it'll make our lives much easier to use a text editor.</p>
<p>In any case, in order to save our commands or edit text files,
a text editor is very helpful.
Programmers use text editors to write programs,
but because programmers may often be working in graphical user environments,
they may often use more specific graphical text editors or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment">IDE</a>s.
As systems administrators, we might not always have a
graphical user interface installed on a server.
The servers that we manage might contain limited software
that does not serve its main purpose as as server because
any non-relevant software on the system takes up disk space,
consumes resources, and/or poses a security threat.
In such cases, we might have to use a text editor built for the
text user interface.</p>
<p>Fortunately, there are lots of options.
In this lesson, I will demonstrate how to use three different
commandline based text editors.
I will start off with two that are complex and not user friendly
(<code>ed</code> and <code>vim</code>),
but will end with a very user-friendly editor that I'll encourage
you all to use in this course (<code>nano</code>).</p>
<p>Although <code>ed</code> and <code>vim</code> are editors that difficult to master,
they are also very powerful editors.
I use both daily, and
am in fact writing in this in <code>vim</code>.
I believe they are worth learning;
however, for the purposes of this course,
I think it's more important that you are aware of them.
If you wish to learn more,
there are lots of additional tutorials on the web on how to use these
fine, esteemed text editors.</p>
<a class="header" href="11-text-editors.html#ed" id="ed"><h2><code>ed</code></h2></a>
<p><code>ed</code> is a line editor, and
it's one of the most likely text editors
to be installed on a Linux distribution,
but <code>nano</code> might eventually take its place.
<code>ed</code>, or an early version of it,
is also the first text editor for the Unix operating system and
was developed by Ken Thompson, one of the Unix creators, in the late 1960s.
It was written without computer monitors in mind
because those were still uncommon,
and instead for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teleprinter">teletypewriters (TTYs)</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2B-U-5ylvWo">printers</a>.
If you visit that second link,
what you will see is the terminal interface from those earlier days.
It is the same basic interface you are using now
when you use your terminal applications,
which are virtualised versions of those old teletypewriters.
I think this is a testament of the power of the terminal---that
advanced computer users still use the
same basic technology today.</p>
<p>In practice, when we use a line editor like <code>ed</code>,
the main process of entering text is like any other editor.
The big difference is when we need to manipulate the text.
In a graphical based text editor,
if we want to delete a word or edit some text,
we might backspace over the text or highlight a word and delete it.
In a line editor,
we manipulate text by referring to lines or across multiple lines and
then run commands on the text in those line(s).
This is much the same process we followed when we covered
<code>grep</code>, <code>sed</code>, and <code>awk</code>, and especially <code>sed</code>,
and it should not surprise you that <a href="https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/sed-awk/1565922255/ch02s01.html">these are related</a>.</p>
<p>To operationalize this,
this means that each line has an <strong>address</strong>,
that the address for line 7 is, for example, <strong>7</strong>, and so forth.
Line editors like <code>ed</code> are command driven.
There is no menu to select from at the top of the <em>window</em>,
and in fact, when we used <code>ed</code> to open an existing file,
the text in the file isn't even printed on the screen.
Instead, if a user wants to delete a word,
or print (to screen) some text,
the user first has to direct the line editor to the
relevant line by its address and
then command the line editor to delete the word on that line,
or print the line.
Line editors can also work on ranges of line,
including all the lines in the file,
just like <code>sed</code> does.</p>
<p>In fact, many of the commands that <code>ed</code> uses are also used by <code>sed</code>.
To compare:</p>
<table><thead><tr><th> Command         </th><th> <code>sed</code>   </th><th> <code>ed</code>   </th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td> append text     </td><td> <code>a</code>     </td><td> <code>a</code>    </td></tr>
<tr><td> replace text    </td><td> <code>c</code>     </td><td> <code>c</code>    </td></tr>
<tr><td> delete text     </td><td> <code>d</code>     </td><td> <code>d</code>    </td></tr>
<tr><td> insert text     </td><td> <code>i</code>     </td><td> <code>i</code>    </td></tr>
<tr><td> print text      </td><td> <code>p</code>     </td><td> <code>p</code>    </td></tr>
<tr><td> substitute text </td><td> <code>s</code>     </td><td> <code>s</code>    </td></tr>
<tr><td> print w/ line # </td><td> <code>=</code>     </td><td> <code>n</code>    </td></tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>However, there are big differences that mainly relate
to the fact that <code>ed</code> is a text editor
and <code>sed</code> is not.
For example, here are some commands available in <code>ed</code> only.
<code>sed</code> can usually accomplish these tasks,
but in a non-trivial way.</p>
<table><thead><tr><th> Command                 </th><th> <code>ed</code> only   </th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td> edit file               </td><td> <code>e</code>         </td></tr>
<tr><td> name file               </td><td> <code>f</code>         </td></tr>
<tr><td> join lines              </td><td> <code>j</code>         </td></tr>
<tr><td> copies lines            </td><td> <code>t</code>         </td></tr>
<tr><td> moves lines             </td><td> <code>m</code>         </td></tr>
<tr><td> undo                    </td><td> <code>u</code>         </td></tr>
<tr><td> saves file              </td><td> <code>w</code>         </td></tr>
<tr><td> quits <code>ed</code>            </td><td> <code>q</code>         </td></tr>
<tr><td> Quits <code>ed</code> w/o saving </td><td> <code>Q</code>         </td></tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>There are other differences,
but these are sufficient for our purposes.</p>
<p>Let's see how to use <code>ed</code> to open a file,
and print the content with and without line numbers.
In the following examples,
the comma <code>,</code> is shorthand for the entire file:</p>
<pre><code>ed operating-systems.csv

</code></pre>
<p>Using <code>ed</code>, another way to remove the header line of the
<strong>operating-systems.csv</strong> file is to specify the line number (<code>1</code>)
and then the delete command (<code>d</code>), just like in <code>sed</code>.
This becomes a permanent change if I save the file
with the <code>w</code> (write) command:</p>
<pre><code>1d

Android, Apache, 2008
</code></pre>
<p>To refer to line <strong>ranges</strong>, I add a comma between <strong>addresses</strong>.
Therefore, to edit lines 1, 2, and 3,
but then quit without saving:</p>
<pre><code>1,3d

</code></pre>
<p>Note that with <code>sed</code>, in order to make a change <strong>in-place</strong>,
we need to use the <code>-i</code> option.
But with <code>ed</code>,
all changes persist on the file and
are saved with the <code>w</code> command.</p>
<p>I can use <code>ed</code> to <strong>find and replace</strong> strings.
The syntax is the same as it is in <code>sed</code>.
I'll start with a fresh version of the file:</p>
<pre><code>ed operating-systems.csv
183
,s/Linux/GNU\/Linux/
</code></pre>
<p>If we want to add new rows to the file,
we can append <code>a</code> or insert <code>i</code> text
after  or at specific lines.
To append text after line 3, use <code>a</code>:</p>
<pre><code>3a
FreeDOS, GPL, 1998
.
</code></pre>
<p>Because enter input mode when using the <code>a</code>, <code>i</code>, or <code>c</code> commands,
we have to enter a period <code>.</code> on a line by itself to revert
to command mode.</p>
<p>To insert at line 2, use <code>i</code>:</p>
<pre><code>2i
CP/M, Proprietary, 1974
.
</code></pre>
<p>Like <code>sed</code>, we can also <strong>find and replace</strong> using
regular expressions instead of line numbers.
I start a new <code>ed</code> session to reload the file to start fresh:</p>
<pre><code>ed operating-systems.csv
183
/Linux/s/Linux/GNU\/Linux/
</code></pre>
<p>Of course, <code>ed</code> can be used to write and not simply edit files.
Let's start fresh, in the following session,
I'll start <code>ed</code>,
enter append mode <code>a</code>,
write a short letter,
exit append mode <code>.</code>,
name the file <code>f</code>
write <code>w</code> (save) the file,
and quit <code>q</code>:</p>

<p>It's good to know something about <code>ed</code> not just for cultural reasons,
but also because the line editing technology developed for it
is still in use today,
and is a basic part of the <code>vim</code> text editor,
which is a very widely used application.</p>
<a class="header" href="11-text-editors.html#vim" id="vim"><h2><code>vim</code></h2></a>
<p>The <code>vim</code> text editor is a take on the <code>vi</code> text editor
and is in fact called <strong>Vi IMproved</strong>.
(The <code>vi</code> text editor is usually available via the <code>nvi</code>
command these days.)
Although <code>vim</code> is not a line editor,
but a screen oriented editor,
it is multi-modal like <code>ed</code> and
in fact is its direct descendant through <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vi">vi</a>.
Due to this genealogy,
<code>vim</code> can use many of the same commands as <code>ed</code> does
when <code>vim</code> is in command mode.
Like <code>ed</code>, we can start <code>vim</code> at the Bash prompt
with or without a file name.
Here I will open the <strong>letter.txt</strong> file with <code>vim</code>,
and will automatically be in <strong>command mode</strong>:</p>
<pre><code>vim letter.txt

</code></pre>
<p>To enter <strong>insert mode</strong>,
I can type <code>i</code> or <code>a</code> for <strong>insert</strong> or <strong>append</strong> mode.
There isn't any difference on an empty file,
but on a file that has text,
<code>i</code> will start <strong>insert</strong> mode where the cursor lies,
and <strong>a</strong> will start <strong>insert</strong> mode right-adjacent to the cursor.
Once in <strong>insert</strong> mode,
you can type text as you normally would and
use the arrow keys to navigate around the file.</p>
<p>To return to <strong>command mode</strong> in <code>vim</code>,
you press the <strong>Esc</strong> key.
And then you can enter commands like you would with <code>ed</code>,
using the same syntax.</p>
<p>Unlike <code>ed</code>, when in <strong>command mode</strong>,
the commands we type are not placed wherever the cursor is,
but at the bottom of the screen.
Let's first turn on line numbers so we know which address is which,
and then we'll replace <strong>ed</strong> with <strong>Ed</strong>.
Note that I precede these commands with a colon:</p>
<pre><code>:set number
:5s/ed/Ed/
</code></pre>
<p>One of the more powerful things about both <code>ed</code> and <code>vim</code> is that
I can call Bash shell commands from the editors.
Let's say that I wanted to add the date to my letter file.
To do that, Linux has a command called <code>date</code> that when typed and executed,
will return today's date and time.
To call the <code>date</code> command within Vim and insert the output into the
file, I press <strong>Esc</strong> to enter <strong>command mode</strong>
(if I'm not already in it),
enter a colon,
and then use the shell escape command,
which is an exclamation point <code>!</code>,
type a space,
then <code>r</code> for the read file into buffer command,
and then the Bash shell <code>date</code> command:</p>
<pre><code>:r !date

</code></pre>
<p>Since the last edit I made was to replace <strong>ed</strong> with <strong>Ed</strong>,
<code>vim</code> entered the date after that line, which is line 6.
To move that date line to the top of the letter,
I can use the move <code>m</code> command and move it to line 0,
which is the top of the file:</p>
<pre><code>:6m0

</code></pre>
<p>Although you can use the arrow keys and Page Up/Page Down keys
to navigate in <code>vim</code> and <code>vi</code>,
by far the most excellent thing about this editor is to be
able to use the <strong>j,k,l,h</strong> keys :</p>
<ul>
<li><code>j</code> moves down line by line</li>
<li><code>k</code> moves up line by line</li>
<li><code>l</code> moves right letter by letter</li>
<li><code>h</code> moves left letter by letter</li>
</ul>
<p>Like the other commands, you can precede this with addresses.
To move 2 lines down, you type <code>2j</code>, and so forth.
<code>vi</code> and <code>vim</code> have had such a powerful impact on
software development that you can in fact use these
same keystrokes to navigate a number of sites
such as Gmail, Facebook, Twitter, and more.</p>
<p>To save the file and exit <code>vim</code>,
we return to <strong>command mode</strong> by pressing the <strong>Esc</strong> key,
and then write and quit:</p>
<pre><code>:wq
</code></pre>
<p>The above barely scratches the surface.
There are whole books on these editors as well
as websites, videos, etc that explore them, and
especially <code>vim</code> in more detail.
But now that you have some familiarity with them,
you might find this funny: <a href="https://www.gnu.org/fun/jokes/ed-msg.en.html">Ed, man! !man ed</a>.</p>
<a class="header" href="11-text-editors.html#nano" id="nano"><h2><code>nano</code></h2></a>
<p>The <code>nano</code> text editor is the user-friendliest of these text editors but
still requires some adjustment as a new command line user.
The friendliest thing about <code>nano</code> is that it is modeless,
which is what you're already accustomed to using,
because it can be used to enter text and manipulate text
without changing to insert or command mode.
It is also friendly because,
like many graphical text editors and other graphical software,
it uses control keys to perform its operations.
The tricky part is that the control keys are assigned
to different keystroke combinations than what
many graphical editors (or word processors) use.
For example, instead of Ctrl-c or Cmd-c to copy,
in <code>nano</code> you press the <code>Alt-6</code> keys
(press <code>Alt</code> and <code>6</code>) to copy.
Then to paste, you press <code>Ctrl-u</code> instead of the more common <code>Ctrl-v</code>.
Fortunately, <code>nano</code> lists the shortcuts at the bottom of the screen.</p>
<p>The shortcuts listed need some explanation, though.
The carat mark is shorthand for the keyboard's <strong>Control (Ctrl)</strong> key.
Therefore to Save As a file,
we <strong>write</strong> out the file by pressing <code>Ctrl-o</code>.
The <strong>Alt</strong> key is also important,
and the shorthand for that is <code>M-</code>.
To mark (highlight) text, you press <code>Alt-a</code>,
which is listed as <code>M-A</code> in the shortcut
list at the bottom of the screen,
then move the cursor over the text that you want to highlight.
If your goal is to copy,
then press <strong>Alt-6</strong> to copy the marked (highlighted) text.
Move to where you want to paste the text,
and press <strong>Ctrl-u</strong> to paste.</p>
<p>For the purposes of this class,
that's all you really need to know about <code>nano</code>.
Use it and get comfortable writing in it.
Some quick tips:</p>
<ol>
<li><code>nano file.txt</code> will open and display the file named <strong>file.txt</strong>.</li>
<li><code>nano</code> by itself will open to an empty page.</li>
<li>Save a file by pressing <code>Ctrl-o</code>.</li>
<li>Quit and save by pressing <code>Ctrl-x</code>.</li>
<li>Be sure to follow the prompts at the bottom of the screen.</li>
</ol>

<p>In prior lessons, we learned how to use the Bash interactive shell and
how to view, manipulate, and edit files from that shell.
In this lesson, we learned how to use several command line text editors.
This allows us to save our commands, create scripts,
and in the future, edit configuration files.</p>
<p>The commands we used in this lesson include:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>ed</code> : line-oriented text editor</li>
<li><code>vim</code> : Vi IMproved, a programmer's text editor</li>
<li><code>nano</code> : Nano's ANOther editor, inspired by Pico</li>
</ul>
