<ul>
<li>In the late 1970s, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Stallman">Richard Stallman</a> noticed
that software began to become commercialized.
<ul>
<li>As a result, hardware vendors stopped sharing
the code they developed to make their hardware work.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Software code became eligible for copyright protection with
the Copyright Act of 1976</li>
<li>Stallman, who thrived in a <em>hacker culture</em>,
began to battle against this turn of events.</li>
<li>Stallman created the <a href="https://www.gnu.org/gnu/gnu.html">GNU project</a>,
the free software philosophy, GNU Emacs,
a popular and important text editor,
and he wrote many other programs.</li>
<li>The GNU project is an attempt to create a completely
<strong>free software</strong> operating system,
that was Unix-like, called GNU.</li>
<li>By the early 1990s, Stallman and others had developed
all the utilities needed to have a full operating system,
except for a kernel, which they called <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/hurd/">GNU Hurd</a>.</li>
<li>This included the Bash shell, written by <a href="https://opuslogica.com/">Brian Fox</a>.</li>
<li>The GNU philosophy includes several propositions
that define free software:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>The four freedoms, per GNU Project:</p>
<ol start="0">
<li>The freedom to run the program as you wish,
for any purpose (freedom 0).</li>
<li>The freedom to study how the program works,
and change it so it does your computing as you wish (freedom 1).
Access to the source code is a precondition for this.</li>
<li>The freedom to redistribute copies so you can help others (freedom 2).</li>
<li>The freedom to distribute copies of your modified
versions to others (freedom 3).
By doing this you can give the whole community a chance
to benefit from your changes.
Access to the source code is a precondition for this.</li>
</ol>

<li>The former was aimed at commercialization,

<li>UNIX Systems Laboratories, Inc. (USL, part of AT&amp;T)
sued Berkeley Software Design, Inc.

<ul>
<li>On August 25, 1991, <a href="https://www.cs.helsinki.fi/u/torvalds/">Linus Torvalds</a>
announced that he had started working on a <strong>free</strong>
operating system kernel for the 386 CPU architecture
and for his specific hardware.</li>
<li>This <a href="https://www.kernel.org/">kernel</a> would later be named <strong>Linux</strong>.</li>
<li>Linux technically refers only to the kernel.
<ul>
<li>An operating system kernel handles startup,
devices, memory, resources, etc.</li>
<li>A kernel does not provide userland utilities---the
kinds of software they people use when using computers.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Torvalds' motivation was to learn about OS development
but also to have access to a Unix-like system.
<ul>
<li>He already had access to an Unix-like system
called <a href="https://www.minix3.org/">MINIX</a>,
but MINIX had technical and copyright restrictions.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Torvalds has stated that if a BSD or
if GNU Hurd operating system were available,
then he may not have created the Linux kernel.</li>
<li>But Torvalds and others took the GNU utilities
and created what is now called Linux or GNU/Linux.</li>

<ul>
<li>Soon after the Linux development,
people would create their own Linux and
GNU based operating systems and would distribute them.</li>
<li>As such, these Linux operating systems became
referred to as <em>distributions</em>.</li>
<li>The two oldest distributions that are still in
active development include:
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.slackware.com/">Slackware</a></li>

<ul>
<li>Unix version numbers 1-6 eventually led to BSD 1-4.</li>
<li>At BSD 4.3, all versions had some AT&amp;T code.
<ul>
<li>Desire to remove this code led to BSD Net/1.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>All AT&amp;T code was removed by BSD Net/2.</li>
<li>BSD Net/2 was ported to the Intel 386 processor.
<ul>
<li>This became 386BSD and was made available in 1992,
a year after the Linux kernel was released.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>386BSD split into two projects:
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.netbsd.org/">NetBSD</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.freebsd.org/">FreeBSD</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>NetBSD split into another project: <a href="https://www.openbsd.org/">OpenBSD</a>.</li>
<li>All three of these BSDs are still in active development.</li>
<li>From a bird's eye point of view, they each have different focuses:
<ul>
<li>NetBSD focuses on portability (MacOS, NASA)</li>
<li>FreeBSD focuses on wide applicability
(WhatsApp, Netflix, PlayStation 4, MacOS)</li>
<li>OpenBSD focuses on security
(has contributed a number of very important applications)</li>
</ul>

<p>MacOS is based on <a href="http://www.puredarwin.org/">Darwin</a>,
is <a href="https://www.opengroup.org/membership/forums/platform/unix">technically UNIX</a>, and is
partly based on FreeBSD with some code
coming from the other BSDs.

<p>In the free software and open source landscape,
there are several important free and/or open source
licenses that are used.
The two biggest software licenses are
based on the software used by GNU/Linux
and the software based on the BSDs.
They each take very different approaches to free
and/or open source software.
The biggest difference is this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Software based on software licensed under the GPL
must also be licensed under the GPL.
This is referred to as <a href="https://www.gnu.org/licenses/copyleft.en.html">copyleft</a> software,
and the idea is to propagate free software.
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html">GNU General Public License (GPL)</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Software based on software licensed under the BSD
license may be closed source and
primarily must only attribute the original source code and author.
<ul>
