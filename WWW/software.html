      <h2>Learn the Command Line</h2>

  <p>Most of the coding I do is for analyzing data for my research projects.
  However, I wrote several programs to help introduce my undergraduate and
  graduate students to the Linux command line. These are useful if you're
  running Linux or have access to a Linux machine and the Bash shell.</p>

  <p>Instructions for downloading and using the scripts above
  are on the GitHub repo:
  <a href="https://github.com/cseanburns/learn-the-commandline">Learn the Command Line</a>.</p>

  <ul>
    <li><code>learn-the-cli</code> is an interactive Bash
      script that walks users through a set of common commands
      and lets them practice the commands.</li>
    <li><code>learn-the-cli-module</code> is a modification of the above
        program that allows users to select specific sections to practice.</li>
    <li><code>learn-the-filesystem</code> is an interactive
      Bash Script that builds off the <code>learn-the-cli</code>
      script but focuses on navigating the Linux directory
      tree and learning the differences between absolute and
      relative paths.</li>
    <li><code>flashcards</code> is a modified shell script that
      helps users memorize a set of common commands. This comes
      with a <b>cards.csv</b> file containing the data for
      the script.</li>
  </ul>
