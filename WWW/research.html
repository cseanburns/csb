<h2>Bias in Peer Review</h2>

<p><a href="http://www.uky.edu/~cfox/">Charles Fox</a>,
an ecologist and entomologist at
the University of Kentucky, and
I met because I gave a talk at
<a href="https://libraries.uky.edu">UK Libraries</a>
for Open Access week in the Fall 2013 semester.
In our first meeting,
when he gave me a tour of his lab,
we both learned that we were interested
in bias in the peer review process, and
that led to a series of studies published from 2015 to 2017.
As we prepared the data analysis for the bias studies,
we conducted the study on article titles,
listed below.
Working with Dr. Fox was a great learning experience,
so much so that I think of it as a kind of postdoc.
But it was great to learn how someone
in the life sciences thinks about problems.</p>

<h2>Health Information Retrieval</h2>

<p>I was among the first people,
I believe, to publish an empirical study on
<em>megajournals</em>,
and in the process of conducting a follow up study,
I noticed odd search result discrepancies
in various bibliographic databases.
The searches were all related to medical journals,
and that led me to ask some people who research
health information about
what was happening in these systems.
Our discussions led to some conference
presentations and to a couple of
published papers on the problems
we had discussed.</p>

<ul>

    Burns, C.S., Shapiro II, R.M., Nix, T., &amp; Huber, J.T. (2019).

<h2>Journals</h2>

<p>I published one paper on megajournals, and
I meant to conduct more studies,
but the discrepancies I mentioned above
led to the health information retrieval
project and away from this project.
Some other people have taken off with this
research, which is great,
but I still have some questions, and
I hope to return to this someday.</p>

<p>The <em>Publications</em> article below
is a think piece about some of the problems
I see with the ongoing migration from
print-based publishing to digital-based
publishing.
The article argues that journals that
continue to publish articles in <em>issues</em>
cause gatekeeping problems and
make information retrieval less effective.
I propose a solution to re-think and re-design
journals as digital libraries.</p>

<h2>Reference Librarianship and Qualitative Methodology</h2>

<p>The communication overload paper
below began in my qualitative methodology course,
taught by education psychology
professor Alejandro Morales,
when I was a PhD student.
I recruited
<a href="http://www.jennybossaller.com/">Jenny Bossaller</a>
because her research expertise
included reference librarianship and qualitative inquiry.
Both Morales and Bossaller
later served on my dissertation committee.
When I started this study,
I learned that
<a href="http://www.amyvanscoy.net/">Amy VanScoy</a>
was doing similar research.
VanScoy later reviewed and commented
on the draft we had written and
before it was submitted to the
<em>Journal of Documentation</em>.
So it became natural to want to work with
her on the two follow up studies that we did.</p>

<p>The three of us are interested
in open science topics,
but the open science discussion
largely centers around quantitative research.
Hence our goal with the secondary analysis
papers was to show that open science applies to
qualitative studies, too.</p>

<h2>Fake News (really, documentation)</h2>

<p>I'm super interested in
<a href="https://www.isko.org/cyclo/document">document theory</a>.
The motivation for this study rested
on the idea that how a document is presented,
how it is read, and
how it is sourced can influence
the credibility of its content.
The results reported in the
<em>First Monday</em> paper were unexpected and,
as is usual, led to more questions.
For me, these questions center around
whether information literacy
is as big an issue as generally presented.</p>

<h2>Tacit Knowledge and Open Science</h2>

<p>I taught a knowledge management
course at UK for a good number of years now,
and that has given me a lot of time
to think deeply about tacit knowledge.
Because of my interests in open science,
it was inevitable, I believe,
that I would connect the two concepts.
The paper below started with
a series of lectures I gave in this course,
but I have also given a couple of talks
now on open science and tacit knowledge.
This is also the topic of a book in progress.
So far, though, I have this:</p>

<h2>History of Automation</h2>

<p>One of my professors,
Thomas Kochtanek,
in graduate school would often talk about Ralph Parker,
a former director of the library at the
University of Missouri (MU) and
a founder of the library science school there.
Parker was the first person to automate part
of a library's workflow using punched cards,
but little was known about him.
I took advantage of the archives at MU to
read through his papers and
reports as director of the library there.
It was a great blast to spend
a lot of time in the archives, and
I hope to do that again someday.
Anyway, the time there resulted
in this short history of Parker's contribution
to library automation and to OCLC.</p>

<h2>Electronic Resources</h2>

<p>This paper came out of a discussion
I had with my dissertation committee.
Interestingly, it is currently my most cited work,
and it still gets citations.
Because of the continued interest in this topic,
I would like to follow up on it.
There's still a lot to learn about
institutional repositories at libraries
and their role in the scholarly publishing ecosystem,
which was a big part of my dissertation.</p>
