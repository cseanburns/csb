  <h1>Research</h1>

  <p>This page describes some current projects and
  contains a thematically organized list of
  selected publications with short narratives for background
  information.</p>

  <p>See my <a href="WWW/cv.html">Curriculum Vitae (CV)</a> for more details.</p>

  <h2>Current Projects</h2>

  <p>Project 1: A study of tacit knowledge and open science. My thesis is that
  tacit knowing, Michael Polanyi's idea that <q>we can know more than we can
  tell</q>, challenges the idea that an open science can be fully open. If
  true, this has ramifications for what we can learn from science done more
  openly and for what can be replicated based on a more open science. See <a
  href="https://doi.org/10.7560/IC56104">What documents cannot do: Revisiting
  Polanyi and the tacit knowledge dilemma</a>, which describes this thesis in
  more detail.</p>

  <p>Project 2: A study on ungrading. Ungrading is the idea that we
  can place less emphasis on grades by placing more emphasis on other forms of
  feedback. I practice ungrading in different ways, which is determined whether
  the course is a graduate or undergraduate course, and whether the course is
  discussion or project based. Two colleagues of mine are investigating two of
  my courses, both graduate, but one discussion based and the other project
  based. This is an ongoing research project.</p>

  <p>The first paper for this project was just accepted (Jan. 2024) by the
  <em>Journal of Education for Library and Information Science</em> and will be
  published soon. Further research is ongoing.</p>

  <p>Project 3: A citation analysis of journal articles with specific title
  characteristics. More details later.</p>

  <p>Project 4: A study on open educational resources (OER). More details
  later.</p>

  <h2>Plain Text Social Science</h2>

  <p>I enjoy a <a href="WWW/my-plain-text-social-science.html">Plain Text Way
    To Do Plain Text Social Science</a>.
  I used the plain text research approach to write
  a paper for an upcoming conference. It was fun to write, even though the paper
  was rejected (2022-05-24).

<h2>Research Themes</h2>

<h3>Bias in Peer Review</h3>

<p><a href="http://www.uky.edu/~cfox/">Charles Fox</a>,
an ecologist and entomologist at
the University of Kentucky, and
I met because I gave a talk at
<a href="https://libraries.uky.edu">UK Libraries</a>
for Open Access week in the Fall 2013 semester.
In our first meeting,
when he gave me a tour of his lab,
we both learned that we were interested
in bias in the peer review process, and
that led to a series of studies published from 2015 to 2017.
As we prepared the data analysis for the bias studies,
we conducted the study on article titles,
listed below.
Working with Dr. Fox was a great learning experience,
so much so that I think of it as a kind of postdoc.
But it was great to learn how someone
in the life sciences thinks about problems.</p>

<h3>Health Information Retrieval</h3>

<p>I was among the first people,
I believe, to publish an empirical study on
<em>megajournals</em> (see next section),
and in the process of conducting a follow up study,
I noticed odd search result discrepancies
in various bibliographic databases.
The searches were all related to medical journals,
and that led me to ask some people who research
health information about
what was happening in these systems.
Our discussions led to some conference
presentations and to a couple of
published papers on the problems
we had discussed.</p>

<h3>Journals</h3>

<p>I published one paper on megajournals, and
I meant to conduct more studies,
but the discrepancies I mentioned above
led to the health information retrieval
project and away from this project.
Some other people have taken off with this
research, which is great,
but I still have some questions, and
I hope to return to this someday.</p>

<p>The <em>Publications</em> article below
is a think piece about some of the problems
I see with the ongoing migration from
print-based publishing to digital-based
publishing.
The article argues that journals that
continue to publish articles in <em>issues</em>
cause gatekeeping problems and
make information retrieval less effective.
I propose a solution to re-think and re-design
journals as digital libraries.</p>

<h3>Reference Librarianship and Qualitative Methodology</h3>

<p>The communication overload paper
below began in my qualitative methodology course,
taught by education psychology
professor Alejandro Morales,
when I was a PhD student.
I recruited
<a href="https://www.jennybossaller.com/">Jenny Bossaller</a>
because her research expertise
included reference librarianship and qualitative inquiry.
Both Morales and Bossaller
later served on my dissertation committee.
When I started this study,
I learned that
<a href="https://www.amyvanscoy.net/">Amy VanScoy</a>
was doing similar research.
VanScoy later reviewed and commented
on the draft we had written and
before it was submitted to the
<em>Journal of Documentation</em>.
So it became natural to want to work with
her on the two follow up studies that we did.</p>

<p>The three of us are interested
in open science topics,
but the open science discussion
largely centers around quantitative research.
Hence our goal with the secondary analysis
papers was to show that open science applies to
qualitative studies, too.</p>

<h3>Fake News (really, documentation)</h3>

<p>I'm super interested in
<a href="https://www.isko.org/cyclo/document">document theory</a>.
The motivation for this study rested
on the idea that how a document is presented,
how it is read, and
how it is sourced can influence
the credibility of its content.
The results reported in the
<em>First Monday</em> paper were unexpected and,
as is usual, led to more questions.
For me, these questions center around
whether information literacy
is as big an issue as generally presented.</p>

  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Tacit Knowledge and Open Science</h3>

<p>I taught a knowledge management
course at UK for a good number of years now,
and that has given me a lot of time
to think deeply about tacit knowledge.
Because of my interests in open science,
it was inevitable, I believe,
that I would connect the two concepts.
The paper below started with
a series of lectures I gave in this course,
but I have also given a couple of talks
now on open science and tacit knowledge.
This is also the topic of a book in progress.
So far, though, I have this:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Burns, C.S. (2021).
    What documents cannot do: Revisiting Polanyi
    and the tacit knowledge dilemma.

  </li>
</ul>

<h3>History of Automation</h3>

<p>One of my professors,
Thomas Kochtanek,
in graduate school would often talk about Ralph Parker,
a former director of the library at the
University of Missouri (MU) and
a founder of the library science school there.
Parker was the first person to automate part
of a library's workflow using punched cards,
but little was known about him.
I took advantage of the archives at MU to
read through his papers and
reports as director of the library there.
It was a great blast to spend
a lot of time in the archives, and
I hope to do that again someday.
Anyway, the time there resulted
in this short history of Parker's contribution
to library automation and to OCLC.</p>

<h3>Electronic Resources &amp; Systems Librarianship</h3>

<p>This paper came out of a discussion
I had with my dissertation committee.
Interestingly, it is currently my most cited work,
and it still gets citations.
Because of the continued interest in this topic,
I would like to follow up on it.
There's still a lot to learn about
institutional repositories at libraries
and their role in the scholarly publishing ecosystem,
which was a big part of my dissertation.</p>
