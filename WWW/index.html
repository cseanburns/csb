<h3 id="december-20-2020"><time datetime="2020-12-20">December 20, 2020</time></h3>
<p>I am in a group chat with some college friends. It’s been on and off since the start of the pandemic, but it’s begun to flourish recently. It’s nice because even though it has been nearly 26 years since I’ve seen some of these people, we talk and joke and razz each other as if no time has passed—as if we haven’t become middle aged, as if we haven’t married (or not), raised children, become grandparents, had failures, gone to funerals, gotten divorced, and so much more. Or, despite all that, or because of it all, because we do comment on the intervening years and how much has happened and how it has all affected us.</p>
<p>When I was growing up (nine different public schools, etc), and when I worked as a line cook (21 restaurants and many different states), I lived a fairly nomadic life, as much as that may look like in modern America. It’s meant that most of the people I’ve shared my life with, or have shared their lives with me, are not in my life anymore and never will be again, nor I theirs. There’s a kind of gravitas attached to that, and I didn’t realize how much, like the father in James Baldwin’s <em>Tell Me How Long the Train’s Been Gone</em>, that I was …</p>
<blockquote>
<p>lonely for those faces which had borne witness to that past</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It’s been nice then not just to have this automatic reconnect with these friends, but to have it with these specific friends who once bore witness to some significant years of my past and whose past, significant for them also, I bore witness to.</p>
<p>This loneliness that I had felt was not a nostalgia. I do not wish to relive those days nor recreate them. I am happy with who I am. I’m happy that I have a family and a nice job. I want to keep going and keep growing as a person and with my partner, and to help my little ones become the persons they will be. But still, it’s nice to reconnect and share again. It feels really good.</p>

<h2 id="three-quarters-of-a-year">Three Quarters of a Year</h2>
<h3 id="december-19-2020"><time datetime="2020-12-19">December 19, 2020</time></h3>
<p>Three quarters of a year, and almost three seasons, have passed since the start of this quarantine. My Mom came down with covid recently, and she somehow defied the odds, which were not remotely in her favor–she’s the definition of underlying conditions. I dreaded this happening to her. She works in a big box store in a geographic area where it’s common for people to refuse to wear masks and get aggressive if requested to do so. If the former wasn’t enough for her to more likely contract covid, the latter made it more so. Well, it happened, and I’m so happy that she’s still here with us and that she’s out of danger for now.</p>
<p>In our house, we call this time the Time of the Sickness. Despite all the difficulties (I’ve been trying to learn how to cry again, which helps with mental health), some great good has come out of it for us as a family, and I’m very thankful for that–a very silver lining around a very dark cloud. As if before my very eyes, I’ve watched my youngest transform into a toddler from a baby in a way that I don’t remember noticing with the others, and it’s been fun to watch how this child has latched onto their two older siblings, often mimicking the second oldest and demanding to play with them every chance they get. And I’ve watched my older two become big kids and best friends. I can’t steal the last cookie in the sight of my middle child without that child declaring that I must save it for their older sibling, and the oldest one often gathers the younger two to read to them as they sit on each side. So although it’s been the Time of Sickness and Great Sorrow (too), at least it’s also been the Time of Togetherness.</p>
<p>Like everyone else I hope, I look forward to the end of this Sickness, but I’m not sure how much I want things to change for the family. I’ll still have the option to work remotely, at least for part of the week, and I will probably take that option as much as possible. I’ve grown kinda comfortable working amid the blaring of children.</p>
<p>Update (12/20): Ha, ha! Of course, an hour after I posted this, one kid had a meltdown and the other two started fighting. Such is this roller coaster.</p>

<h2 id="on-ebooks">On Ebooks</h2>
<h3 id="december-8-2020"><time datetime="2020-12-08">December 8, 2020</time></h3>
<p>I purchased an ebook reader recently, and I’m enjoying it. So far I like not adding more print books to my collection. The weight of the ones I have now is too much, although I still value having them.</p>
<p>I like that if I do not become involved with a book that I’m reading on the device, I can simply remove it from the ereader and forget about it. Unread print books haunt me when I see them on my shelves. They remind me that I have somehow committed the sin of uncommitment. I appreciate freeing myself of that type of guilt.</p>
<p>I wonder, though, if my migration to ebooks will have at least one negative consequence. My print books act as indices to parts of my life. I can look at any of the books on my shelves and remember when I got them and where and what I was doing during those times in my life. I know that I will lose that with ebooks. I might have other ways to index my life, though, and I guess that means time will tell, or it won’t.</p>

<p>Tonight I finished reading <em>Exciting Times</em> by Naoise Dolan. I don’t remember why I picked this book, but I think I saw it on a list somewhere. However I chose it, I’m glad I did. It was quite a pleasure.</p>
<p>I am not quite pleased with a couple of reviews of the book that I read. I wanted to see how others thought about the ending, which is why I read the reviews after I read the book. The reviews were positive but also critical in a way that I thought were unwarranted.</p>
<p>So, remind me not to read reviews again. It kind of spoiled the nice feeling I had and tend to get when I’ve just taken in a good story.</p>

<p>I've been playing a lot of Sudoku in recent months and I think I've gotten fairly adept at completing very difficult puzzles. Sometimes when I'm stuck, I’ll work through all the empty cells and add notes for all the possible candidates in each cell. Sometimes that doesn’t help at all and the puzzle looks like a mickle of numbers. However, if I go through and delete all of the candidates and start over, more often than not I'll see what I missed and complete the puzzle.</p>

<h2 id="primate-lessons">Primate Lessons</h2>
<h3 id="november-15-2020"><time datetime="2020-11-15">November 15, 2020</time></h3>
<p>There are a lot of PBS documentaries on primates, and I’ve been watching a bunch of them and realizing how little I know about our fairly close biological relatives.</p>
<p>For example, I did not know that there is often a rigid social hierarchy in many primate groups, as there have been in most human societies throughout history. I wonder, as primates, if we have a kind of default disposition toward that kind of societal structure, too, and if it makes democracy and equality a hard sell for us. If so, then it is fascinating that attempts at democracy and equality have been as successful as they have been for so long here in the US, even if that success has been marginal for many and has fallen short, tragically, in so many ways, but then not surprising that it is so fragile and threatened, as we are discovering these days. I wonder if this default inclination, if it exists, is the reason for the appeal of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strongman_(politics)">strongman</a> among half the population.</p>
<p>These thoughts give me new meaning to King’s quote, that <q>the arc of the moral universe is long, but it bends toward justice.</q> My take on this now is that, it’s a moral universe because we are not simply primates, but the arc is long because we are.</p>

<p>I’ve moved away from listening to podcasts and instead have been listening more to music in recent months. It’s been a great source of comfort. Lately I’ve been revisiting Kris Kristofferson and Willie Nelson’s catalogs. They remind me a bit of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas">home</a>, but not in a nostalgic way, and that’s not why I’ve been listening to them anyway. I think I just forgot how poetic they were, or I never appreciated it until now. I need sung poems.</p>

I remember going to the movies when I was a kid, but there is no year where I remember going to the movies to see all of these, and there’s no year that occupies such an outsized space in my head as that year. It could have been my age, but that can’t be all of the reason.</p>

<p>My middle child, who is not yet writing, thought I asked them to list some ideas they might have for a project. To create their list, they drew eight equal sized rectangles on a sheet of paper, and in five of the rectangles, they drew a picture that captured a specific idea. The remaining three rectangles were left empty.</p>
<p>I simply think the preliterate mind is fascinating, but it also made me think about lists differently.</p>

<p>One of the difficult parts of R is simply cleaning and prepping the data. I’m curious if that part of a research project would be better served using Awk, since Awk is a data-driven programming language, and then let R (or Python) take over for the analysis. I think I might give it a go with this next research project I’m working on with some colleagues. It will be a challenge, but I bet it might pay off nicely down the road.</p>
<p>Update: I suppose I should have titled this post with the Awk equivalent for find and replace, instead of the sed version. Oi!</p>

<h3 id="september-12-2020"><time datetime="2020-09-12">September 12, 2020</time></h3>
<p>I have been using Linux for a long time now. In the early years it felt kind of magical and new and mysterious, and what I really mean is that using the command line felt that way, and would have felt that way if I was using the CLI on any *nix-based operating system. It is a really comforting place for me to be, and sometimes I wish it was the only computing interface needed.</p>
<p>The magic and mystery faded a few years ago. I suppose that’s likely to happen with lots of things. Getting stuff done became more important. Then I proposed an undergraduate course on Linux systems administration, and in teaching that course, I have discovered new things about the OS and rediscovered experiences I had long ago.</p>
<p>That’s all. I simply wanted to reflect on this for a moment, and be grateful that though I have people in my life that are infinitely more meaningful than a computer, I have this small thing that brings me calm.</p>

The clouds kept the moon hidden and the street and surrounding house lights were off or too far away to have an effect. The darkness was beautiful and eerie and almost total.</p>

<p>I couldn’t let go the last Bash script <a href=WWW/index.html#on-distractions>On Distractions</a>. As I read more about <code>awk</code>, I learned that it was possible to write <a href="https://blog.jpalardy.com/posts/awk-tutorial-part-2/">multiple condition-block</a> statements. It then occurred to me I could write a (long) <em>one-liner</em> using this technique and that the Bash function and the <code>awk</code> <strong>if-else</strong> statement were unnecessary:</p>
<pre><code>#!/bin/bash
systemctl status --user mbsync.timer |\
         awk -F&quot;;&quot;\
         &#39;/Trigger:/ &amp;&amp; $2 == &quot;&quot; { print &quot;Syncing...&quot;}
         /Trigger:/ &amp;&amp; $2 != &quot;&quot; { print &quot;Time left to sync: &quot; $2}&#39;</code></pre>
<p>The code instructions:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Run the <code>systemctl</code> command</li>
<li>Pipe output to <code>awk</code></li>
<li>Do a regex search for <strong>Trigger:</strong></li>
<li>If the output is <strong>NULL</strong>, then the systemd timer is syncing and print that.</li>

<h2 id="on-distractions">On Distractions</h2>
<h3 id="august-26-2020"><time datetime="2020-08-26">August 26, 2020</time></h3>
<p>It was a fairly productive day, but I’m not sure how I got anything done. Lots of distractions.</p>
<p>My first distraction of the day was all my fault. I use <code>mbsync</code> to retrieve email and I have a <code>systemd</code> timer (instead of a <code>cron</code> job) set to retrieve email every five minutes. This is the first time I’ve used <code>systemd</code> instead of <code>cron</code>. It’s fine, but even though I have no skin in the <code>systemd</code> controversy, I'm often annoyed by the length of some of the commands. For instance, to see when <code>mbsync</code> would next sync my email to my desktop, I’d type this out:</p>
<pre><code>systemctl status --user mbsync.timer</code></pre>
<p>I wanted to fix that. I could have taken better advantage of Bash history, but I thought I could make it a bit more entertaining, and this morning I decided to write a small function to replace that whole line, and I also thought that I’d write it so it would simply return the time left until the next sync. So I wrote this:</p>
<pre><code>systemctl status --user mbsync.timer |\
  grep -F &quot;Trigger:&quot; |\
  awk -F&quot;;&quot; &#39;{ print &quot;Time left to sync: &quot; $2 }&#39;</code></pre>
<p>And that worked fine. It would output something like:</p>
<pre><code>Time left to sync: 4min 17s left</code></pre>
<p>That’s pretty much what I wanted, and all was rosy until I ran the function and got something meaningless in return. Then I realized that <code>mbsync</code> was syncing at the moment that I ran the function and so there was no time info to return. Enter distraction, and I said to myself, “what was the syntax for an <code>awk</code> <strong>if-else</strong> statement.” I’m only beginner level <code>awk</code> writer, and it had been a long time since I played around with <code>awk</code> conditionals.</p>
<p>But I worked at it and kept boinking the <strong>if</strong> statement up, and there were many other distractions that had nothing to do with any of this, but eventually, I got rid of the bugs, and now when <code>mbsync</code> is syncing, my little script checks if field two is null, then returns "Syncing ...", else it prints the time left to sync, per the <code>systemd</code> status message:</p>
<pre><code>#!/bin/bash

# Check how much time left to sync email
# Aug 26, 2020
# Sean Burns

gettime () {
  awk -F&quot;;&quot; &#39;{
    if($2==&quot;&quot;)
      print &quot;Syncing ...&quot;;
    else
      print &quot;Time left to sync: &quot; $2
    }&#39; 
}

# Replaced grep with awk (8/29/2020):
#systemctl status --user mbsync.timer | grep -F &quot;Trigger:&quot; | gettime
systemctl status --user mbsync.timer | awk &#39;/Trigger:/&#39; | gettime
</code></pre>

<p>Specifically, when <code>mbsync</code> is syncing, it tells me:</p>
<pre><code>Syncing ...</code></pre>
<p>It's things like this that make primarily working at the command line fun in the same way that playing and solving a hard Sudoku puzzle is fun. And I learned something, too, which I'm happy about because I think <code>awk</code> is a neat programming language.</p>

<p>I’ve begun the migration to Fedora Linux. I installed it on my laptop, replacing an Ubuntu installation, and have really liked it. If I complete the migration, this will be the first non-Debian based distribution that I’ve used as my main OS since the early 2000s, when I used to run Red Hat Linux and Mandrake Linux, my first two GNU/Linux OSs.</p>
<p>I’ve been using Fedora for a few years now on a server and have also used it as the demo server in my Linux SysAdmin course, so it’s not entirely new to me. What’s new to me is the desktop version. I like the take on Gnome (although I prefer i3), which seems to work much better than it does on Ubuntu.</p>
<p>I may switch back to Ubuntu someday. Who knows? But in the meantime, it feels kinda good to distro hop—feels like my first days with Linux.</p>

<p>I read Nathaniel Hawthorne's short story, <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/holocaust">Earth's Holocaust</a>, about 25+ years ago, and re-read it recently because I kept thinking about it these last few years.

Now that I am in the social sciences, I can tell I read it much differently. But since that old me is still there inside, it felt like two different, almost conflicting, identities were reading it at the same time. Regardless, though, it's still a depressing tale, and the question stands from my two readings: is the human heart forever condemned, or can institutions solve our base tendencies?</p>

<h3 id="may-8-2020"><time datetime="2020-05-08">May 8, 2020</time></h3>
<p>I like that turn of phrase, &quot;I've found myself doing something.&quot; When a person says or thinks that, it's not that they just discovered what they were doing but that perhaps they realized there was a mystery about the thing they already knew they were doing, which of course, suggests that there were doing something they didn't know they were doing.</p>
<p>I've found myself recently watching lots of online videos of people sailing around the world. I think I must be watching these videos for two, perhaps seemingly conflicting reasons.</p>
<p>The obvious reason is that these videos are a way to escape. Times are rough right now. Who wouldn't want to get away from the Threat and see beautiful parts of the world and all the great oceans and seas.</p>
<p>But most of the videos I've been watching are of people sailing around the world either on their own or with a partner or a small family. They go long stretches of time without seeing others. It's not just escaping then. It's social distancing. It's how it feels right now.</p>

<h3 id="may-7-2020"><time datetime="2020-05-07">May 7, 2020</time></h3>
<p>I've kept a book on the bookshelf now for over thirty years. It's not a long book, and I don't know who gave it to me, but someone did, and I have never read it, nor its companion book (it's a series, I guess) that I also have.</p>
<p>I might read it, but the book has always weirded me out. The book has almost no information about the author or translators or the series, and there's no copyright date and the copyright page is non-standard. There are blurbs in the front matter, but they seem made up---part of the book's fiction. It was printed on good paper and was well made. It looks as new as it ever did, even the jacket, which it still has.</p>
<p>Over the years, as the web grew, I thought I could find more information about it. I've never thoroughly tried to research the work---only cursory searches. It shows up on Amazon and various book sites and apparently is held by very few libraries, but these listings do not provide background information. Author or publisher information is absent on the web. There are some short reviews on a few sites, and they say brief, delightful things, but they are not informative otherwise.</p>
<p>It's the oddest little thing. Kind of a mystery, and I kind of like that, even though it really does weird me out.</p>

<p>This is something like the 44th day of our Quarantine. I am fortunate that this whole thing mostly feels surreal, but sometimes I see it playing out like it's a movie.</p>
<p>Movie opens with a family preparing breakfast before school and work, and chatting about their day or arguing about some random thing. TV plays in the background and news reporter is covering a virus outbreak in Wuhan, China.</p>
<p>A couple of weeks later, and the scene is on a different person or a group of people. Perhaps a couple in their bedroom at night who are watching TV before going to sleep. News about the virus becomes more frequent and urgent. Couple briefly talk about it and wonder if it'll impact them somehow.</p>
<p>Again, another week or so later, and another person, like a teacher in a break room or something. Reports are coming in faster about the virus, and it's spreading. Teacher is eating lunch while watching the reports.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, hospitals, particularly in the US northeast and US northwest, start to see increased visits from people with flu like symptoms.</p>
<p>Then, week before quarantine. The virus has spread to multiple countries, but the threat is still abstract for most people in the film. But people are increasingly becoming infected, according to the reports. Lots of uncertainty. Decision making, personal, commercial, governmental, is on hold until uncertainties are addressed. Information goes out about washing hands, not touching faces, and then a bit later, social distancing.</p>
<p>Then the Quarantine. Some experience just horror---especially those on the front lines, while others experience economic hardship, or other types of losses. Others are simply experiencing a wait, and the whole thing feels like a slog to them. Some become impatient or perhaps are suffering under hardships, and begin to vent through protest.</p>

<p>A long time ago, I worked as a cook at a restaurant alongside an old chef who taught me a lot about cooking. I was thinking about him recently because he once told me that in order to make good chicken stock, I had to use vegetables that I would be willing to serve to guests. That meant no onion skins or carrot shavings, or like, but peeled onions, shaved carrots, and like.</p>
<p>Dave, I'm here to tell you that you were wrong. I've been making vegetable broth with saved vegetable trimmings only. So, only onion peels, carrot shavings, and like. And the broth I've been making has an incredible aroma and taste.</p>
<p>As I started to write this, I texted a friend of mine that stayed in that area, and asked about that old chef. He texted back that he had heard that the old chef had passed away about 15 or so years ago, possibly from an AIDS related illness.</p>

<p>I am often surprised by people behaving inconsistently with their strongly, espoused beliefs, and I can only think of three explanations for why it happens.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>They do not behave consistently because they haven't thought through their beliefs.</li>
<li>They do not believe what they espouse but espouse in order to signal.</li>
<li>Their beliefs are not as strong as they espouse.</li>
</ol>
<p>I kind of tested this a bit recently on a person who acknowledged that they were behaving inconsistently with their previously and strongly espoused beliefs. They responded by with a shrug. I suppose, if they were responding truthfully, that that indicates (3).</p>
<p>So, I don't know. People are interesting, as another friend said to me recently about a different matter.</p>

<p>I worked in many restaurants and did so for many years, but it has been 13 years since my last job in one. I used to have the standard, common, nightmare restaurant dreams when I worked in them, but it's been a long time since I had one of those. This week, I've had two of them.</p>
<p>Last night I dreamt I was visiting a restaurant (in today's time) that I worked at 20 years ago. There was some desparation in the air, and I was asked to take over the grill station at the last minute just as the restaurant was opening. But I no longer knew the menu, and all the prep was wrong. Steaks were cut in grossly uneven portions and in different shapes, as were various vegetables, and so everything was cooking wrong. The oversized things were burning on the outside but were raw on the inside, and the undersized things were burning throughout. The tickets were coming in faster.</p>
<p>Go away restaurant dreams.</p>
<p>I hope you're all okay, my old restaurant friends.</p>

<h2 id="an-action-under-which-description">An Action Under Which Description</h2>
<h3 id="april-11-2020"><time datetime="2020-04-11">11 April 2020</time></h3>
<p>I can imagine a conversation where one person asks an other person what they are doing.</p>
<p><strong>Case 1:</strong></p>
<p>The person walks into a room. The other person is on the computer writing an email. The first person asks, &quot;what are you doing?&quot; The other person replies, &quot;I'm on the computer.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Case 2:</strong></p>
<p>Here is another scenario where the action is fairly similar but the tool different, and therefore I imagine, the response is different, and more specific.</p>
<p>The person walks into a room. The other person is hand writing a letter on a legal pad. The first person asks, &quot;what are you doing?&quot; The other person replies, &quot;I'm writing a letter.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Case 3:</strong></p>
<p>In the last scenario, the tool is the same as in Case 1, but the action is obvious, and therefore the response is specific as in Case 2.</p>
<p>The person walks into a room. The other person is on the computer playing a video game. The first person asks, &quot;what you you doing?&quot; The other person replies, &quot;I'm playing a video game.&quot;</p>
<br/>
<p><strong>Thoughts:</strong></p>
<br/>
<p><strong>Case 1:</strong></p>
<p>I'm wondering if we default to the less descriptive action when the tool that we are using affords a broad range of functions. Thus:</p>
<p>&quot;I'm on the computer&quot; versus &quot;I'm writing an email.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Case 2:</strong></p>
<p>I'm also wondering if we default to a more descriptive action when the tool that we are using affords a narrow range of functions. For example:</p>
<p>&quot;I'm writing a letter&quot; on a legal pad versus &quot;I'm on a legal pad.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Case 3:</strong></p>
<p>In the last case, I'm wondering if we default to a more descriptive action regardless of the affordances offered by the tool if the action is obvious in some way.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm playing a game&quot; on the computer versus &quot;I'm on the computer.&quot;</p>
<p>Under what other actions on a computer might the specificity of our descriptions vary, I also wonder.</p>
<p>Why do our descriptions vary?</p>
<p>These are some initial thoughts on <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/anscombe/#ActThe">action</a> and affordances.</p>

<p>I imagine many people in higher education are wondering how the pandemic will change our work. I haven't measured it, but I have noticed that the volume of email I receive (and send) has dropped substantially.</p>
<p>I can think of a lot of reasons for why that might be, and I'm sure there are a lot of reasons. The major idea I have is that people have less time to work because they might be at home and having to mind children, but also worry about relatives, and like, and when they can get work in, they're doing the really essential stuff, like teaching and research. In a way, it could be leading to more efficiency, but that's just a hypothesis, and perhaps something to test down the line.</p>
<p>I mean, perhaps it's just me who is getting less email, but I've heard from one colleague in a different college that this experience was true for them, too. However, I would wager that what we're experiencing right now will be woven into the fabric of what we're calling the new normal. That is, these behaviors will persist. We'll see, I suppose.</p>

<p>Like many people who are fortunate to have a job during this pandemic, I am working from home. I have a desktop machine at the office at work, but I didn't bring it home, and instead am using a laptop with a small ~13-inch screen.</p>
<p>When I tried to use this laptop more intensively in the past, I found it frustrating to do any kind of substantial work. My desktop machine has a nice sized monitor, and sometimes two of them, and I had gotten very used to them. So I am surprised that I have become quite adjusted to working completely off a small screen, and have even enjoyed using it as a primary device to do all the same work that I was doing on my desktop. I have even found that it's helped with focus.</p>

<p>We went for a walk yesterday on a short trail in the city, just to get everyone out of the house and to be in a place where few people might be congregating. There were a few others on the trail, and what was interesting was that whenever we would pass these people on the trail, no one would look at us, or smile, or say hi. All heads were kept down.</p>
<p>That kind of distancing isn't common, in my experience. People are generally friendly on the trails, and so although I'm guessing, I think it's because this is how people interpret <em>social distancing</em> --- we don't just physically distance ourselves from each other --- we also distance ourselves from strangers in deeper ways. I noticed this kind of thing at the grocery store the other day. There I thought it was simply because people were becoming competitive for goods, but I'm guessing it goes beyond that. If this is a good interpretation, it worries me.</p>
<p>This pandemic is going to have long lasting consequences across a broad range of our societies.</p>

<p>I had mentioned before that over the years I had made some acquaintances as a neighborhood walker. These were fellow walkers, too.

Of course that explained why I hadn't seen him since then, and I was worried the last time I saw him. He had been in a wheelchair for a while, but still roamed the streets, and the last time I saw him, he had his pant legs drawn up to his knees so that his heavily bruised, swollen skin was exposed to the subfreezing temperature. I told him to pull his pant legs down, and he responded as if he wasn't even aware that they had been pulled up.</p>
<p>He was an alcoholic, probably a diabetic, and he certainly had other health issues. I met his partner once. She was nice, and he described me to her as if I were an old friend.</p>
<p>It was nice talking with him over the years.</p>

<p>There are usually just a few number of reasons why an infant cries. They need to burp, they need a diaper change, they need to eat, they need to sleep, or they are not feeling well.</p>
<p>So it's kind of neat to see them cry for a new reason. Like when they are annoyed by something. Even though it's sad or hard in some way to see them cry, when they cry for a reason that's not directly related to a physical need, it's kind of a marker that they are becoming a toddler, and thus, that they are developing a sense of self. It's kind of a beautiful thing to witness, as a parent, I think.</p>

<p>However, I knew I was missing a piece of information, and I also needed the reference. I remembered that I read about the event in a specific book, which I had read in 2009. I pulled my copy of the book from my bookshelf and scanned the index for TREC, but the term wasn't there.

That led me to a journal article that I had also read ten years ago and that covered the event in more detail.</p>

<h3 id="december-23-2019"><time datetime="2019-12-23">23 December 2019</time></h3>
<p>I was watching a young child (8 years old) use a word processor application for the first time. The child knows how to write, relative to their age, but had practiced writing mostly on paper. I learned a lot by watching them:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>We started by launching a word processor application and a new, blank page. Even though an entire blank page appears, since the default position of the cursor is at the beginning, no part of the page was accessible. The child didn't understand why the entire page was not accessible but that what was only accessible was the point up to the cursor. The child was initially confused by being presented a <em>page</em> or a <em>sheet of paper</em> and not having the ability to use it like they would use a physical sheet of paper.</li>
<li>The child therefore had to learn how to create space, even though the page looks like a piece of paper, all that space doesn't yet exist. The child had to learn how to create empty space by using the space bar and the enter key. This <em>page</em> or <em>sheet of paper</em> metaphor that a word processor presents is really powerful but obviously not coherent with physical sheets of paper. The strength of this incomplete metaphor had never really occurred to me before.</li>
<li>Eventually the child created a few pages of content by writing a story for their book that they're writing. The red squiggly lines that appeared underneath misspelled words were a source of distraction for the child, who once they understood what they signified, wanted to stop and edit before completing their writing. To me, this violates the <em>write first, edit later</em> principle. I turned that function off to help the child focus on one thing at a time.</li>
<li>The child's interpretation of the page indicator at the bottom of the screen was interesting. After the child created a few pages of content, they moved the cursor to the third of the fourth page. The child then noticed the page indicator for the first time, which stated &quot;Page 3 of 4&quot;, and asked why their book (which is what they were writing) could be no more than four pages. That is, to the child, that &quot;of 4&quot; suggested all the pages that could exist for their book.</li>
</ol>
<p>This is not the first time the child had written on a computer, but it was the first time I had let them use a word processor application. A couple of times before, I let the child write in the <a href="https://www.nano-editor.org/">Nano</a> text editor. None of the above issues came up because Nano does not use the page metaphor or most other indicators besides a cursor. The cursor on Nano is more obviously on a screen, and not a <em>page</em> or <em>sheet of paper</em>.</p>

<pre><code>&quot;last name, first name&quot;,&quot;username&quot;,&quot;email address&quot;</code></pre>
<p>My goal was to grep and yank a username out of the file and then insert that into a <code>s-nail</code> command in order to send local email. Took less than a minute to write, which is probably why it was fun:</p>
<pre><code>grep -i username email.csv | awk -F, &#39;{ print $3 }&#39; | sed &#39;s/&quot;//g&#39;</code></pre>
<p>Then I put that one-liner into a text file and made it executable and generalizable with a positional parameter:</p>
<pre><code>#!/bin/bash

grep -i &quot;$1&quot; email.csv | awk -F, &#39;{ print $3 }&#39; | sed &#39;s/&quot;//g&#39;</code></pre>

<h3 id="june-10-2019"><time datetime="2019-06-10">10 June 2019</time></h3>

<p>Although I may <a href="WWW/index.html#on-writing-and-its-tools">fiddle</a>
with Vim, terminal, or some other command line settings when I'm
procrastinating, it's also true that playing around with these settings or
exploring some other part of my work flow can help me find my calm. For
example, a few nights ago I felt a bit anxious about life things, and instead
of watching some show or reading some book, I went to my laptop and read
documentation on the <a href="http://mutt.org/">Mutt</a> email client, and
I was able to configure Mutt in a way that I had not thought was previously
possible, even after using Mutt for something like 15 or so years. The end
result was just calming. To get lost in the documentation, to read it closely,
to apply it to my application---it was just nice.</p>

<p><a href="WWW/index.html#the-walkers">Walking</a> is also a calming routine
for me, and of course it has health benefits. Exploring technology has some
nice practical side effects, too. That is, because I find, generally, the
command line to be a much less disruptive, more pleasing computing environment,
because of the CLI framework, using it requires me to learn more about
computing itself.</p>

<p>Understanding why I like to play with technology helps me be a better
teacher. It allows me to empathize, or try to, with my students, and try to
understand what they find interesting about exploring or not exploring
technical topics. If I can empathize with them about it, then I can help them
find their own path and their own joy in understanding the world around them,
even if their path or joy is different from mine.</p>

<h2 id="the-walkers">The Walkers</h2>
<h3 id="may-19-2019"><time datetime="2019-05-19">19 May 2019</time></h3>

<p>I walk a lot. I walk to work, to the grocery store, around the neighborhood,
to friends' houses, on lunch breaks. I like to walk because it feels good. My
legs are often restless and need to move, but I also like to walk because it's
a quieting experience.</p>

<p>I've long been a walker. When I lived in the Seattle area, I walked to and
from work. It was seven miles each way and took about an hour and 45 minutes.
I started drinking coffee because of this walk. I don't remember the weather
there being incredibly cold, but it was cold and wet enough to seep through to
the bones, and for the first time in my life, black coffee started to taste
good and feel restorative. It was then that Seattle made some sense to me.</p>

<p>One of the interesting things about walking is that you are more likely,
I think, to notice the other walkers. When I lived in Missouri, there was
a woman who was a walker, and I would see her all over town, pretty decent
miles apart, just walking, hands in her pocket. Here in Lexington, I know of
a number of walkers. There's one man who shares an appearance with Shaggy, but
he's much taller, bulked up, and a bit intimidating. He always, always carries
papers with him. For years, they were stuffed in a manila envelope. I would see
him on the other side of town, and still he had those papers under his left
arm, crammed in that manila envelope. Sometime recently he acquired a shoulder
bag, which now bursts with those same papers, I assume. It's very mysterious
and intriguing. There's another person, I'll call him <em>B</em>, who used to
walk all around my neighborhood, but then due to some illness, transferred to
a walker, and now he's in a wheelchair. Still, he gets around.</p>

<p>Another interesting thing about being a walker is that I sometimes develop
some kind of relationship with other walkers. <em>B</em> and I talk a bit. He
knows what I do for a living and just about every time we speak, he tells me he
would like to have become a librarian if he could start all over again. It
comes across as a life gone wrong kind of regret. Even if we walkers don't
speak to each other, there's the nod, although it often has to be earned. When
the man with the manila envelope and I first passed each other on the sidewalk
five or so years ago, he wouldn't acknowledge me. After a couple of years of
this, he began to return my nod, but his nods were always subtle---just
a slight downward motion. Nowadays, the nods are deeper and stretched out, but
I don't see him very often anymore. More mystery.</p>

<p>There are other walkers, too. There's the guy who works at a local store. We
often pass each other on the way to our jobs, located in opposite directions,
and may share a couple of words in that passing. Sometimes it feels like it's
a disruption to his own quieting, as if acknowledging me is a burden, and
I feel bad about that because I respect the quieting. There's the guy who
dances as he walks. There are others.</p>

<p>I like the walkers. I don't know if they're good or bad people. I know
a little of <em>B</em>'s story, but I don't know anything about the others.
Maybe I should dare to ask, but I also like the mysteriousness of it all, and
I like that they seem to be private people. And I like that they've always been
there, no matter where I've lived.</p>

<h2 id="on-solitude">On Solitude</h2>
<h3 id="april-28-2019"><time datetime="2019-04-28">28 April 2019</time></h3>

<p>The right writing tools help, but there are two other problems that deter
good work. First, good work requires solitude and long bouts of it. Second, the
web has destroyed space. Solitude requires space. Therefore, by entailment, the
web has destroyed solitude. My premises overreach and simplify but not by far,
I think.</p>

<p>Even as I write this, there's a part of me that wants to go look up
something on the web. Even though I haven't had social media in a long time,
I still have the desire sometimes to share a tweet or a post. Even if I'm
physically alone, the web feels inside me and invasive, and it is noisy.</p>

<p>I need to retrain myself to be disconnected. Back in 1993, when I was
a junior in college, I spent a semester at a major research library. There was
the occasional letter or phone call, and periodical social gatherings during
lunch or in the evening, but for the most part, for nine weeks of that
semester, all I did was research. I read, took notes, and wrote, and after
a while of this, I put together a long paper. I did that, just as my classmates
did, without the web or the internet, and the focus came easy.</p>

<p>It's true that I have many more responsibilities today, but there must be
a way to re-train my mind to feel that solitude and find that kind of focus
again. I touched it recently. Last summer we went camping for a week. I was
alone on the first night and it was great. Even when we were all together, our
phones didn't have a connection, and by the end of that week, the focus had
begun to return as the world had begun to recede.</p> <p>I think this summer
I'll re-read Erazim Kohák's wonderful book <a
href="http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/29603308">The embers and the stars:
A philosophical inquiry into the moral sense of nature</a>. The book was gifted
to me by one of my professors when I graduated college and became one of my
favorite books, and I think it'll help equip me with the mental tools needed to
get that focus back.</p>

<h2 id="on-writing-and-its-tools">On Writing and its Tools</h2>
<h3 id="april-26-2019"><time datetime="2019-04-26">26 April 2019</time></h3>

<p>It feels like I used to have an academic writing voice and because I had
that voice, writing came easily.</p>

<p>I remember when I lost that voice and writing suddenly felt sluggish. I was
taking a philosophy course in graduate school and was trying to write a paper
on a difficult topic that was also quite new to me, and during the struggle of
thinking through the problem, it felt like something cracked in my mind.
I could almost hear a once coherent thing in my head fracture like a loud clap
on a thunderous night.</p>

<p>My quest to find the perfect writing tools began well before this event. The
initial motivation I had for learning Linux was because I found it offered
tools, like Vim and Emacs and the terminal itself, that afforded a much nicer,
liberating, and less distracting writing experience than the options that were
available at the time on other operating systems, but something about that
event made that quest hyperactive.</p>

<p>Losing that coherent voice had some odd side effects. I think I can sit down
and write despite whatever mood I am in, but the mood will dictate the tool
I use. Sometimes sitting at a computer feels stifling and writing just seems
impossible. To attempt to write this way feels like I must first break through
some great barrier. Then, writing by hand can feel less resistant.</p>

<p>If I continue to use the computer, though, I have to be careful because
I can easily get distracted by the tools themselves. I might begin to fiddle
too much with my Vim configuration or my terminal settings---altering the
terminal color scheme, font type, or font size repeatedly---and end up not
writing at all. If I can recognize this frenetic mood quickly enough, but can't
write by hand because I need the tools on my computer for some reason, I might
switch to a different writing program, like a regular word processor, and find
that just by doing so the writing comes more freely.</p>

<p>And then sometimes writing weirdly comes easiest when I am composing an
email. I think I may have written half the first draft of my dissertation as
Gmail messages to no one. But writing this way, as if I was writing to someone,
as if I had an idea of an audience, felt good and was productive. I haven't
been able to replicate that experience with the current version of Gmail. The
interface has changed too much and writing in Gmail now feels
uncomfortable.</p>

<p>While my academic writing voice feels fractured, my creative writing voice
does not, but the right tool helps here, too. I have an old 1950s era
Smith-Corona typewriter. I use this machine to write for fun---mostly letters
to family and friends. Writing this kind of material on this machine has been
a relaxing pastime.</p>

<h3 id="april-25-2019"><time datetime="2019-04-25">25 April 2019</time></h3>

<p>I started typing this in the <a
href="https://www.gnu.org/software/ed/ed.html">ed</a> text editor. My go-to
editor is Vim, but ed can be a respite for even that minimal interface. The
problem is that even with editors like Vim, there is still a temptation to mix
modes -- to edit as I write. Since I find it much more cumbersome to edit with
ed as I write, using ed places more focus on the writing process.</p>

<p>I particularly enjoy writing in ed with the terminal in full screen mode. It
is probably overkill because I already use the minimalist i3 (tiled) window
manager, but even with i3 and Vim I get distracted by mixing up my modes -- by
writing and editing concurrently. Ed forces me to write because switching and
working in different modes in ed (input mode to edit mode) is unlike switching
and working in different modes in Vim, and the latter is easier. To edit in
Vim: press the escape key, move around the screen, make the desired edits,
repeat, done. In ed, start a new line, press period (.) to enter command mode,
print to screen the range of text to edit, make edits using regular
expressions, repeat, done. This is all a bit cumbersome, and the process
encourages me to avoid using it.</p>

<p>I do not altogether avoid editing in ed, and a side benefit of editing with
ed is that it has made me a more advanced Vim user. Even though I have been
using Vim for 15 plus years, I am still learning.</p>

<h2 id="keeping-it-minimal">Keeping it Minimal</h2>
<h3 id="april-23-2019"><time datetime="2019-04-23">23 April 2019</time></h3>

<p>My 30 plus year history with computing has been a history of keeping things
minimal.</p>

<p>In the 80s, I had a Tandy 1000 SL with, I think, MS-DOS 3.x. That computer
lasted for about six or seven years, and I enjoyed it and learned a lot about
computers by primarily using the DOS command line.</p>

<p>I brought my computer with me when I went to college in 1991, but I also
used the computers in the college's library. I don't know what kind of
computers these were, but what I really liked about them was that they had
WordPerfect 5.1. Like the word processors we have today, I didn't use the vast
majority of the functions WP 5.1 offered, but what I liked about it was that,
like all DOS-based applications at the time, its interface was <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Wordperfect-5.1-dos.png">minimal</a>.
I felt comfortable and at home in that DOS minimalism, and have never stopped
seeking or recreating it since.</p>

<p>My Tandy stopped booting sometime around 1994 or so, and I graduated at the
end of 1995. I went several years without my own computer, but in 1998
I started working for a company and had to use a computer with Windows 95, and
then later I bought my next computer, which had Windows 98.</p>

<p>The graphical user interface was entirely new to me, and I hated how busy it
was. In the early 2000s, it occurred to me that it would be nice to install WP
5.1 on my computer so that I could have that full screen, single application
interface that I found so appealing. By this time, it was already too late. WP
5.1 was gone, but in my search, I found other ways to recreate a minimal
writing experience when I found <a
href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/">Emacs</a>, and then <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vim_(text_editor)">Vi/Vim</a>, and of
course, Linux. It's now been about 16 years since I first installed Linux.</p>

<p>The computing world had only grown more complicated and busy, but I still
like to keep it as simple as I can. I use the <a
href="https://i3wm.org/">i3</a> window manager, after having used <a
href="https://www.nongnu.org/ratpoison/">ratpoison</a> for years. I practically
live in the terminal, and <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bash_(Unix_shell)">Bash</a>, Vim, and <a
href="http://www.mutt.org/">Mutt</a> are my primary applications. If I could
only use <a href="http://w3m.sourceforge.net/">w3m</a> all of the time, I'd be
even happier.</p>
