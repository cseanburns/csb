<p>It feels like I used to have an academic writing voice and because I had that voice, writing came easily.</p>
<p>I remember when I lost that voice and writing suddenly felt sluggish. I was taking a philosophy course in graduate school and was trying to write a paper on a difficult topic that was also quite new to me, and during the struggle of thinking through the problem, it felt like something cracked in my mind. I could almost hear a once coherent thing in my head fracture like a loud clap on a thunderous night.</p>
<p>My quest to find the perfect writing tools began well before this event. The initial motivation I had for learning Linux was because I found it offered tools, like Vim and Emacs and the terminal itself, that afforded a much nicer, liberating, and less distracting writing experience than the options that were available at the time on other operating systems, but something about that event made that quest hyperactive.</p>
<p>Losing that coherent voice had some odd side effects. I think I can sit down and write despite whatever mood I am in, but the mood will dictate the tool I use. Sometimes sitting at a computer feels stifling and writing just seems impossible. To attempt to write this way feels like I must first break through some great barrier. Then, writing by hand can feel less resistant.</p>
<p>If I continue to use the computer, though, I have to be careful because I can easily get distracted by the tools themselves. I might begin to fiddle too much with my Vim configuration or my terminal settings---altering the terminal color scheme, font type, or font size repeatedly---and end up not writing at all. If I can recognize this frenetic mood quickly enough, but can't write by hand because I need the tools on my computer for some reason, I might switch to a different writing program, like a regular word processor, and find that just by doing so the writing comes more freely.</p>
<p>And then sometimes writing weirdly comes easiest when I am composing an email. I think I may have written half the first draft of my dissertation as Gmail messages to no one. But writing this way, as if I was writing to someone, as if I had an idea of an audience, felt good and was productive. I haven't been able to replicate that experience with the current version of Gmail. The interface has changed too much and writing in Gmail now feels uncomfortable.</p>
<p>While my academic writing voice feels fractured, my creative writing voice does not, but the right tool helps here, too. I have an old 1950s era Smith-Corona typewriter. I use this machine to write for fun---mostly letters to family and friends. Writing this kind of material on this machine has been a relaxing pastime.</p>

<h2 id="using-ed-the-standard-text-editor">Using ed, the standard text editor</h2>
<h3 id="april-25-2019"><time datetime="2019-04-25">25 April 2019</time></h3>
<p>I started typing this in the <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/ed/ed.html">ed</a> text editor. My go-to editor is Vim, but ed can be a respite for even that minimal interface. The problem is that even with editors like Vim, there is still a temptation to mix modes -- to edit as I write. Since I find it much more cumbersome to edit with ed as I write, using ed places more focus on the writing process.</p>
<p>I particularly enjoy writing in ed with the terminal in full screen mode. It is probably overkill because I already use the minimalist i3 (tiled) window manager, but even with i3 and Vim I get distracted by mixing up my modes -- by writing and editing concurrently. Ed forces me to write because switching and working in different modes in ed (input mode to edit mode) is unlike switching and working in different modes in Vim, and the latter is easier. To edit in Vim: press the escape key, move around the screen, make the desired edits, repeat, done. In ed, start a new line, press period (.) to enter command mode, print to screen the range of text to edit, make edits using regular expressions, repeat, done. This is all a bit cumbersome, and the process encourages me to avoid using it.</p>
<p>I do not altogether avoid editing in ed, and a side benefit of editing with ed is that it has made me a more advanced Vim user. Even though I have been using Vim for 15 plus years, I am still learning.</p>

<h2 id="keeping-it-minimal">Keeping it minimal</h2>
<h3 id="april-23-2019"><time datetime="2019-04-23">23 April 2019</time></h3>
<p>My 30 plus year history with computing has been a history of keeping things minimal.</p>
<p>In the 80s, I had a Tandy 1000 SL with, I think, MS-DOS 3.x. That computer lasted for about six or seven years, and I enjoyed it and learned a lot about computers by primarily using the DOS command line.</p>
<p>I brought my computer with me when I went to college in 1991, but I also used the computers in the college's library. I don't know what kind of computers these were, but what I really liked about them was that they had WordPerfect 5.1. Like the word processors we have today, I didn't use the vast majority of the functions WP 5.1 offered, but what I liked about it was that, like all DOS-based applications at the time, its interface was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Wordperfect-5.1-dos.png">minimal</a>. I felt comfortable and at home in that DOS minimalism, and have never stopped seeking or recreating it since.</p>
<p>My Tandy stopped booting sometime around 1994 or so, and I graduated at the end of 1995. I went several years without my own computer, but in 1998 I started working for a company and had to use a computer with Windows 95, and then later I bought my next computer, which had Windows 98.</p>
<p>The graphical user interface was entirely new to me, and I hated how busy it was. In the early 2000s, it occurred to me that it would be nice to install WP 5.1 on my computer so that I could have that full screen, single application interface that I found so appealing. By this time, it was already too late. WP 5.1 was gone, but in my search, I found other ways to recreate a minimal writing experience when I found <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/">Emacs</a>, and then <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vim_(text_editor)">Vi/Vim</a>, and of course, Linux. It's now been about 16 years since I first installed Linux.</p>
<p>The computing world had only grown more complicated and busy, but I still like to keep it as simple as I can. I use the <a href="https://i3wm.org/">i3</a> window manager, after having used <a href="https://www.nongnu.org/ratpoison/">ratpoison</a> for years. I practically live in the terminal, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bash_(Unix_shell)">Bash</a>, Vim, and <a href="http://www.mutt.org/">Mutt</a> are my primary applications. If I could only use <a href="http://w3m.sourceforge.net/">w3m</a> all of the time, I'd be even happier.</p>
