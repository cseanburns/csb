<p>It's been 35 days since our Quarantine. Fortunately, everyone I know is well, but I feel great sadness for all those that have suffered and especially for those that have died alone. Too many.</p>

<h2 id="an-action-under-which-description">An Action Under Which Description</h2>
<h3 id="april-11-2020"><time datetime="2020-04-11">11 April 2020</time></h3>
<p>I can imagine a conversation where one person asks an other person what they are doing.</p>
<p>Case 1:</p>
<p>The person walks into a room. The other person is on the computer writing an email. The first person asks, &quot;what are you doing?&quot; The other person replies, &quot;I'm on the computer.&quot;</p>
<p>Case 2:</p>
<p>Here is another scenario where the action is fairly similar but the tool different, and therefore I imagine, the response is different, and more specific.</p>
<p>The person walks into a room. The other person is hand writing a letter on a legal pad. The first person asks, &quot;what are you doing?&quot; The other person replies, &quot;I'm writing a letter.&quot;</p>
<p>Case 3:</p>
<p>In the last scenario, the tool is the same as in Case 1, but the action is obvious, and therefore the response is specific as in Case 2.</p>
<p>The person walks into a room. The other person is on the computer playing a video game. The first person asks, &quot;what you you doing?&quot; The other person replies, &quot;I'm playing a video game.&quot;</p>
<p>Thoughts.</p>
<p>Case 1:</p>
<p>I'm wondering if we default to the less descriptive action when the tool that we are using affords a broad range of functions. Thus:</p>
<p>&quot;I'm on the computer&quot; versus &quot;I'm writing an email.&quot;</p>
<p>Case 2:</p>
<p>I'm also wondering if we default to a more descriptive action when the tool that we are using affords a narrow range of functions. For example:</p>
<p>&quot;I'm writing a letter&quot; on a legal pad versus &quot;I'm on a legal pad.&quot;</p>
<p>Case 3:</p>
<p>In the last case, I'm wondering if we default to a more descriptive action regardless of the affordances offered by the tool if the action is obvious in some way.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm playing a game&quot; on the computer versus &quot;I'm on the computer.&quot;</p>
<p>Under what other actions on a computer might the specificity of our descriptions vary, I also wonder.</p>
<p>Why do our descriptions vary?</p>
<p>These are some initial thoughts on <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/anscombe/#ActThe">action</a> and affordances.</p>

<h2 id="the-slow-down">The Slow Down</h2>
<h3 id="april-09-2020"><time datetime="2020-04-09">09 April 2020</time></h3>
<p>I imagine many people in higher education are wondering how the pandemic will change our work. I haven't measured it, but I have noticed that the volume of email I receive (and send) has dropped substantially.</p>
<p>I can think of a lot of reasons for why that might be, and I'm sure there are a lot of reasons. The major idea I have is that people have less time to work because they might be at home and having to mind children, but also worry about relatives, and like, and when they can get work in, they're doing the really essential stuff, like teaching and research. In a way, it could be leading to more efficiency, but that's just a hypothesis, and perhaps something to test down the line.</p>
<p>I mean, perhaps it's just me who is getting less email, but I've heard from one colleague in a different college that this experience was true for them, too. However, I would wager that what we're experiencing right now will be woven into the fabric of what we're calling the new normal. That is, these behaviors will persist. We'll see, I suppose.</p>

<h3 id="april-04-2020"><time datetime="2020-04-04">04 April 2020</time></h3>
<p>Like many people who are fortunate to have a job during this pandemic, I am working from home. I have a desktop machine at the office at work, but I didn't bring it home, and instead am using a laptop with a small ~13-inch screen.</p>
<p>When I tried to use this laptop more intensively in the past, I found it frustrating to do any kind of substantial work. My desktop machine has a nice sized monitor, and sometimes two of them, and I had gotten very used to them. So I am surprised that I have become quite adjusted to working completely off a small screen, and have even enjoyed using it as a primary device to do all the same work that I was doing on my desktop. I have even found that it's helped with focus.</p>

<h2 id="on-research-speed">On Research Speed</h2>
<h3 id="march-26-2020"><time datetime="2020-03-26">26 March 2020</time></h3>
<p>For the longest time, I felt insanely guilty for not writing research manuscripts fast enough. Sometimes, I was even guilted by collaborators. I don't blame them, though, because as I've aged into this research, I've come to better understand how I work and think through problems, and I didn't necessarily have these insights before now. Nowadays, I'm perfectly fine being a bit slow, and I'm better at communicating that with collaborators. That, my friends, feels good.</p>

<p>The whole point of the social sciences is to acquire the knowledge needed to improve society, and then apply that knowledge. But the coronavirus epidemic is highlighting all the points of failure across our various systems: healthcare, politics, economics, education, etc.</p>
<p>I hope we get through this with minimal harm, but I also hope that we learn how to build a society that is more just and caring to all, and that is based on all the things we know work towards that kind of system.</p>

<h2 id="on-social-distancing">On Social Distancing</h2>
<h3 id="march-16-2020"><time datetime="2020-03-16">16 March 2020</time></h3>
<p>We went for a walk yesterday on a short trail in the city, just to get everyone out of the house and to be in a place where few people might be congregating. There were a few others on the trail, and what was interesting was that whenever we would pass these people on the trail, no one would look at us, or smile, or say hi. All heads were kept down.</p>
<p>That kind of distancing isn't common, in my experience. People are generally friendly on the trails, and so although I'm guessing, I think it's because this is how people interpret <em>social distancing</em> --- we don't just physically distance ourselves from each other --- we also distance ourselves from strangers in deeper ways. I noticed this kind of thing at the grocery store the other day. There I thought it was simply because people were becoming competitive for goods, but I'm guessing it goes beyond that. If this is a good interpretation, it worries me.</p>
<p>This pandemic is going to have long lasting consequences across a broad range of our societies.</p>

<h2 id="losing-a-walker-friend">Losing a Walker Friend</h2>
<h3 id="march-12-2020"><time datetime="2020-03-12">12 March 2020</time></h3>
<p>I had mentioned before that over the years I had made some acquaintances as a neighborhood walker. These were fellow walkers, too. I found out this morning that one of them, <em>B</em>, who I had mentioned <a href="WWW/index.html#the-walkers">in a previous post</a>, passed away a couple of months ago. Of course that explained why I hadn't seen him since then, and I was worried the last time I saw him. He had been in a wheelchair for a while, but still roamed the streets, and the last time I saw him, he had his pant legs drawn up to his knees so that his heavily bruised, swollen skin was exposed to the subfreezing temperature. I told him to pull his pant legs down, and he responded as if he wasn't even aware that they had been pulled up.</p>
<p>He was an alcoholic, probably a diabetic, and he certainly had other health issues. I met his partner once. She was nice, and he described me to her as if I were an old friend.</p>
<p>It was nice talking with him over the years.</p>
<p>Rest in peace, <em>B</em>.</p>

<h3 id="march-06-2020"><time datetime="2020-03-06">06 March 2020</time></h3>
<p>There are usually just a few number of reasons why an infant cries. They need to burp, they need a diaper change, they need to eat, they need to sleep, or they are not feeling well.</p>
<p>So it's kind of neat to see them cry for a new reason. Like when they are annoyed by something. Even though it's sad or hard in some way to see them cry, when they cry for a reason that's not directly related to a physical need, it's kind of a marker that they are becoming a toddler, and thus, that they are developing a sense of self. It's kind of a beautiful thing to witness, as a parent, I think.</p>

<p>I'm testing out the <a href="https://regolith-linux.org/">Regolith version</a> of the <a href="https://i3wm.org/">i3</a> window manager. I really like it but I don't know if I'll make the switch permanent. Regolith makes i3 very nice looking and I really like the Gnome integration, but Regolith has different keybindings, and the keybindings are different enough to make it annoying and, in some cases, feel more cumbersome to use.</p>
<p>The keybindings are configurable, but because of the Gnome integration, there are a lot more than there are in standard i3, and it's annoying to go through the configuration file and make the changes.</p>
<p>I bet someone has created a more aligned i3 configuration file for Regolith. I might look for that.</p>
<p>Perhaps this is a switch that I could work on over the summer.</p>

<p>Every once in a while I'll confuse something in my memory. The other day I was thinking of the TREC experiments but had confused the TREC experiments with the Cranfield experiments from the 1960s. In particular, I was thinking of something that had happened at the Cranfield experiments but had it in my mind that the event had happened at some TREC track.</p>
<p>However, I knew I was missing a piece of information, and I also needed the reference. I remembered that I read about the event in a specific book, which I had read in 2009. I pulled my copy of the book from my bookshelf and scanned the index for TREC, but the term wasn't there. Then I looked for the keyword <em>relevance</em> and found the section that I remembered reading over ten years ago. That led me to a journal article that I had also read ten years ago and that covered the event in more detail.</p>
<p>It was all kind of a meta information retrieval moment about an information retrieval topic, which I thought was kind of funny.</p>
<p>And that is all I have to say on that.</p>

<h2 id="some-observations-on-usability">Some Observations on Usability Pertaining to a Child</h2>
<h3 id="december-23-2019"><time datetime="2019-12-23">23 December 2019</time></h3>
<p>I was watching a young child (8 years old) use a word processor application for the first time. The child knows how to write, relative to their age, but had practiced writing mostly on paper. I learned a lot by watching them:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>We started by launching a word processor application and a new, blank page. Even though an entire blank page appears, since the default position of the cursor is at the beginning, no part of the page was accessible. The child didn't understand why the entire page was not accessible but that what was only accessible was the point up to the cursor. The child was initially confused by being presented a <em>page</em> or a <em>sheet of paper</em> and not having the ability to use it like they would use a physical sheet of paper.</li>
<li>The child therefore had to learn how to create space, even though the page looks like a piece of paper, all that space doesn't yet exist. The child had to learn how to create empty space by using the space bar and the enter key. This <em>page</em> or <em>sheet of paper</em> metaphor that a word processor presents is really powerful but obviously not coherent with physical sheets of paper. The strength of this incomplete metaphor had never really occurred to me before.</li>
<li>Eventually the child created a few pages of content by writing a story for their book that they're writing. The red squiggly lines that appeared underneath misspelled words were a source of distraction for the child, who once they understood what they signified, wanted to stop and edit before completing their writing. To me, this violates the <em>write first, edit later</em> principle. I turned that function off to help the child focus on one thing at a time.</li>
<li>The child's interpretation of the page indicator at the bottom of the screen was interesting. After the child created a few pages of content, they moved the cursor to the third of the fourth page. The child then noticed the page indicator for the first time, which stated &quot;Page 3 of 4&quot;, and asked why their book (which is what they were writing) could be no more than four pages. That is, to the child, that &quot;of 4&quot; suggested all the pages that could exist for their book.</li>
</ol>
<p>This is not the first time the child had written on a computer, but it was the first time I had let them use a word processor application. A couple of times before, I let the child write in the <a href="https://www.nano-editor.org/">Nano</a> text editor. None of the above issues came up because Nano does not use the page metaphor or most other indicators besides a cursor. The cursor on Nano is more obviously on a screen, and not a <em>page</em> or <em>sheet of paper</em>.</p>

<h3 id="september-13-2019"><time datetime="2019-09-13">13 September 2019</time></h3>
<p>I wrote a little Bash one-liner script today that was fun to write. I have a CSV file that looks something like this:</p>
<pre><code>&quot;last name, first name&quot;,&quot;username&quot;,&quot;email address&quot;</code></pre>
<p>My goal was to grep and yank a username out of the file and then insert that into a <code>s-nail</code> command in order to send local email. Took less than a minute to write, which is probably why it was fun:</p>
<pre><code>grep -i username email.csv | awk -F, &#39;{ print $3 }&#39; | sed &#39;s/&quot;//g&#39;</code></pre>
<p>Then I put that one-liner into a text file and made it executable and generalizable with a positional parameter:</p>
<pre><code>#!/bin/bash

grep -i &quot;$1&quot; email.csv | awk -F, &#39;{ print $3 }&#39; | sed &#39;s/&quot;//g&#39;</code></pre>
<p>I named the file <code>emailwho.sh</code> and called it from <code>s-nail</code>:</p>
<pre><code>s-nail -s &quot;subject line&quot; $(emailwho.sh [grep string])</code></pre>
<p>A quick and dirty address book.</p>

<p>Upon reflection, I am skeptical with <a href="https://github.com/matloff/TidyverseSkeptic#start-of-content">Matloff</a>, too. When I was writing R code for my last project and using the Tidyverse <em>dialect</em>, I found myself having to refer continually to the documentation to see how to express each function. Even after repeated use, they just wouldn't stick in my memory. In base-R, and CRAN packages that follow that original dialect, I only have to think about the data and how it's structured in order to slice, filter, etc the data. It felt good reading that piece because now I know it's okay to let it go.</p>

<h2 id="some-routines-i-find-calming">Some Routines I Find Calming</h2>
<h3 id="june-10-2019"><time datetime="2019-06-10">10 June 2019</time></h3>

<p>Although I may <a href="WWW/index.html#on-writing-and-its-tools">fiddle</a>
with Vim, terminal, or some other command line settings when I'm
procrastinating, it's also true that playing around with these settings or
exploring some other part of my work flow can help me find my calm. For
example, a few nights ago I felt a bit anxious about life things, and instead
of watching some show or reading some book, I went to my laptop and read
documentation on the <a href="http://mutt.org/">Mutt</a> email client, and
I was able to configure Mutt in a way that I had not thought was previously
possible, even after using Mutt for something like 15 or so years. The end
result was just calming. To get lost in the documentation, to read it closely,
to apply it to my application---it was just nice.</p>

<p><a href="WWW/index.html#the-walkers">Walking</a> is also a calming routine
for me, and of course it has health benefits. Exploring technology has some
nice practical side effects, too. That is, because I find, generally, the
command line to be a much less disruptive, more pleasing computing environment,
because of the CLI framework, using it requires me to learn more about
computing itself.</p>

<p>Understanding why I like to play with technology helps me be a better
teacher. It allows me to empathize, or try to, with my students, and try to
understand what they find interesting about exploring or not exploring
technical topics. If I can empathize with them about it, then I can help them
find their own path and their own joy in understanding the world around them,
even if their path or joy is different from mine.</p>

<h2 id="the-walkers">The Walkers</h2>
<h3 id="may-19-2019"><time datetime="2019-05-19">19 May 2019</time></h3>

<p>I walk a lot. I walk to work, to the grocery store, around the neighborhood,
to friends' houses, on lunch breaks. I like to walk because it feels good. My
legs are often restless and need to move, but I also like to walk because it's
a quieting experience.</p>

<p>I've long been a walker. When I lived in the Seattle area, I walked to and
from work. It was seven miles each way and took about an hour and 45 minutes.
I started drinking coffee because of this walk. I don't remember the weather
there being incredibly cold, but it was cold and wet enough to seep through to
the bones, and for the first time in my life, black coffee started to taste
good and feel restorative. It was then that Seattle made some sense to me.</p>

<p>One of the interesting things about walking is that you are more likely,
I think, to notice the other walkers. When I lived in Missouri, there was
a woman who was a walker, and I would see her all over town, pretty decent
miles apart, just walking, hands in her pocket. Here in Lexington, I know of
a number of walkers. There's one man who shares an appearance with Shaggy, but
he's much taller, bulked up, and a bit intimidating. He always, always carries
papers with him. For years, they were stuffed in a manila envelope. I would see
him on the other side of town, and still he had those papers under his left
arm, crammed in that manila envelope. Sometime recently he acquired a shoulder
bag, which now bursts with those same papers, I assume. It's very mysterious
and intriguing. There's another person, I'll call him <em>B</em>, who used to
walk all around my neighborhood, but then due to some illness, transferred to
a walker, and now he's in a wheelchair. Still, he gets around.</p>

<p>Another interesting thing about being a walker is that I sometimes develop
some kind of relationship with other walkers. <em>B</em> and I talk a bit. He
knows what I do for a living and just about every time we speak, he tells me he
would like to have become a librarian if he could start all over again. It
comes across as a life gone wrong kind of regret. Even if we walkers don't
speak to each other, there's the nod, although it often has to be earned. When
the man with the manila envelope and I first passed each other on the sidewalk
five or so years ago, he wouldn't acknowledge me. After a couple of years of
this, he began to return my nod, but his nods were always subtle---just
a slight downward motion. Nowadays, the nods are deeper and stretched out, but
I don't see him very often anymore. More mystery.</p>

<p>There are other walkers, too. There's the guy who works at a local store. We
often pass each other on the way to our jobs, located in opposite directions,
and may share a couple of words in that passing. Sometimes it feels like it's
a disruption to his own quieting, as if acknowledging me is a burden, and
I feel bad about that because I respect the quieting. There's the guy who
dances as he walks. There are others.</p>

<p>I like the walkers. I don't know if they're good or bad people. I know
a little of <em>B</em>'s story, but I don't know anything about the others.
Maybe I should dare to ask, but I also like the mysteriousness of it all, and
I like that they seem to be private people. And I like that they've always been
there, no matter where I've lived.</p>

<p>The right writing tools help, but there are two other problems that deter
good work. First, good work requires solitude and long bouts of it. Second, the
web has destroyed space. Solitude requires space. Therefore, by entailment, the
web has destroyed solitude. My premises overreach and simplify but not by far,
I think.</p>

<p>Even as I write this, there's a part of me that wants to go look up
something on the web. Even though I haven't had social media in a long time,
I still have the desire sometimes to share a tweet or a post. Even if I'm
physically alone, the web feels inside me and invasive, and it is noisy.</p>

<p>I need to retrain myself to be disconnected. Back in 1993, when I was
a junior in college, I spent a semester at a major research library. There was
the occasional letter or phone call, and periodical social gatherings during
lunch or in the evening, but for the most part, for nine weeks of that
semester, all I did was research. I read, took notes, and wrote, and after
a while of this, I put together a long paper. I did that, just as my classmates
did, without the web or the internet, and the focus came easy.</p>

<p>It's true that I have many more responsibilities today, but there must be
a way to re-train my mind to feel that solitude and find that kind of focus
again. I touched it recently. Last summer we went camping for a week. I was
alone on the first night and it was great. Even when we were all together, our
phones didn't have a connection, and by the end of that week, the focus had
begun to return as the world had begun to recede.</p> <p>I think this summer
I'll re-read Erazim Kohák's wonderful book <a
href="http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/29603308">The embers and the stars:
A philosophical inquiry into the moral sense of nature</a>. The book was gifted
to me by one of my professors when I graduated college and became one of my
favorite books, and I think it'll help equip me with the mental tools needed to
get that focus back.</p>

<h2 id="on-writing-and-its-tools">On Writing and its Tools</h2>
<h3 id="april-26-2019"><time datetime="2019-04-26">26 April 2019</time></h3>

<p>It feels like I used to have an academic writing voice and because I had
that voice, writing came easily.</p>

<p>I remember when I lost that voice and writing suddenly felt sluggish. I was
taking a philosophy course in graduate school and was trying to write a paper
on a difficult topic that was also quite new to me, and during the struggle of
thinking through the problem, it felt like something cracked in my mind.
I could almost hear a once coherent thing in my head fracture like a loud clap
on a thunderous night.</p>

<p>My quest to find the perfect writing tools began well before this event. The
initial motivation I had for learning Linux was because I found it offered
tools, like Vim and Emacs and the terminal itself, that afforded a much nicer,
liberating, and less distracting writing experience than the options that were
available at the time on other operating systems, but something about that
event made that quest hyperactive.</p>

<p>Losing that coherent voice had some odd side effects. I think I can sit down
and write despite whatever mood I am in, but the mood will dictate the tool
I use. Sometimes sitting at a computer feels stifling and writing just seems
impossible. To attempt to write this way feels like I must first break through
some great barrier. Then, writing by hand can feel less resistant.</p>

<p>If I continue to use the computer, though, I have to be careful because
I can easily get distracted by the tools themselves. I might begin to fiddle
too much with my Vim configuration or my terminal settings---altering the
terminal color scheme, font type, or font size repeatedly---and end up not
writing at all. If I can recognize this frenetic mood quickly enough, but can't
write by hand because I need the tools on my computer for some reason, I might
switch to a different writing program, like a regular word processor, and find
that just by doing so the writing comes more freely.</p>

<p>And then sometimes writing weirdly comes easiest when I am composing an
email. I think I may have written half the first draft of my dissertation as
Gmail messages to no one. But writing this way, as if I was writing to someone,
as if I had an idea of an audience, felt good and was productive. I haven't
been able to replicate that experience with the current version of Gmail. The
interface has changed too much and writing in Gmail now feels
uncomfortable.</p>

<p>While my academic writing voice feels fractured, my creative writing voice
does not, but the right tool helps here, too. I have an old 1950s era
Smith-Corona typewriter. I use this machine to write for fun---mostly letters
to family and friends. Writing this kind of material on this machine has been
a relaxing pastime.</p>

<h3 id="april-25-2019"><time datetime="2019-04-25">25 April 2019</time></h3>

<p>I started typing this in the <a
href="https://www.gnu.org/software/ed/ed.html">ed</a> text editor. My go-to
editor is Vim, but ed can be a respite for even that minimal interface. The
problem is that even with editors like Vim, there is still a temptation to mix
modes -- to edit as I write. Since I find it much more cumbersome to edit with
ed as I write, using ed places more focus on the writing process.</p>

<p>I particularly enjoy writing in ed with the terminal in full screen mode. It
is probably overkill because I already use the minimalist i3 (tiled) window
manager, but even with i3 and Vim I get distracted by mixing up my modes -- by
writing and editing concurrently. Ed forces me to write because switching and
working in different modes in ed (input mode to edit mode) is unlike switching
and working in different modes in Vim, and the latter is easier. To edit in
Vim: press the escape key, move around the screen, make the desired edits,
repeat, done. In ed, start a new line, press period (.) to enter command mode,
print to screen the range of text to edit, make edits using regular
expressions, repeat, done. This is all a bit cumbersome, and the process
encourages me to avoid using it.</p>

<p>I do not altogether avoid editing in ed, and a side benefit of editing with
ed is that it has made me a more advanced Vim user. Even though I have been
using Vim for 15 plus years, I am still learning.</p>

<h2 id="keeping-it-minimal">Keeping it Minimal</h2>
<h3 id="april-23-2019"><time datetime="2019-04-23">23 April 2019</time></h3>

<p>My 30 plus year history with computing has been a history of keeping things
minimal.</p>

<p>In the 80s, I had a Tandy 1000 SL with, I think, MS-DOS 3.x. That computer
lasted for about six or seven years, and I enjoyed it and learned a lot about
computers by primarily using the DOS command line.</p>

<p>I brought my computer with me when I went to college in 1991, but I also
used the computers in the college's library. I don't know what kind of
computers these were, but what I really liked about them was that they had
WordPerfect 5.1. Like the word processors we have today, I didn't use the vast
majority of the functions WP 5.1 offered, but what I liked about it was that,
like all DOS-based applications at the time, its interface was <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Wordperfect-5.1-dos.png">minimal</a>.
I felt comfortable and at home in that DOS minimalism, and have never stopped
seeking or recreating it since.</p>

<p>My Tandy stopped booting sometime around 1994 or so, and I graduated at the
end of 1995. I went several years without my own computer, but in 1998
I started working for a company and had to use a computer with Windows 95, and
then later I bought my next computer, which had Windows 98.</p>

<p>The graphical user interface was entirely new to me, and I hated how busy it
was. In the early 2000s, it occurred to me that it would be nice to install WP
5.1 on my computer so that I could have that full screen, single application
interface that I found so appealing. By this time, it was already too late. WP
5.1 was gone, but in my search, I found other ways to recreate a minimal
writing experience when I found <a
href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/">Emacs</a>, and then <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vim_(text_editor)">Vi/Vim</a>, and of
course, Linux. It's now been about 16 years since I first installed Linux.</p>

<p>The computing world had only grown more complicated and busy, but I still
like to keep it as simple as I can. I use the <a
href="https://i3wm.org/">i3</a> window manager, after having used <a
href="https://www.nongnu.org/ratpoison/">ratpoison</a> for years. I practically
live in the terminal, and <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bash_(Unix_shell)">Bash</a>, Vim, and <a
href="http://www.mutt.org/">Mutt</a> are my primary applications. If I could
only use <a href="http://w3m.sourceforge.net/">w3m</a> all of the time, I'd be
even happier.</p>
