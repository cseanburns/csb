<h2 id="using-ed-the-standard-text-editor">Using ed, the standard text editor</h2>
<h3 id="april-25-2019"><time datetime="2019-04-25">25 April 2019</time></h3>
<p>I started typing this in the <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/ed/ed.html">ed</a> text editor. My go-to editor is Vim, but ed can be a respite for even that minimal interface. The problem is that even with editors like Vim, there is still a temptation to mix modes -- to edit as I write. Since I find it much more cumbersome to edit with ed as I write, using ed places more focus on the writing process.</p>
<p>I particularly enjoy writing in ed with the terminal in full screen mode. It is probably overkill because I already use the minimalist i3 (tiled) window manager, but even with i3 and Vim I get distracted by mixing up my modes -- by writing and editing concurrently. Ed forces me to write because switching and working in different modes in ed (input mode to edit mode) is unlike switching and working in different modes in Vim, and the latter is easier. To edit in Vim: press the escape key, move around the screen, make the desired edits, repeat, done. In ed, start a new line, press period (.) to enter command mode, print to screen the range of text to edit, make edits using regular expressions, repeat, done. This is all a bit cumbersome, and the process encourages me to avoid using it.</p>
<p>I do not altogether avoid editing in ed, and a side benefit of editing with ed is that it has made me a more advanced Vim user. Even though I have been using Vim for 15 plus years, I am still learning.</p>

<h2 id="keeping-it-minimal">Keeping it Minimal</h2>
<h3 id="april-23-2019"><time datetime="2019-04-23">23 April 2019</time></h3>
<p>My 30 plus year history with computing has been a history of keeping things minimal.</p>
<p>In the 80s, I had a Tandy 1000 SL with, I think, MS-DOS 3.x. That computer lasted for about six or seven years, and I enjoyed it and learned a lot about computers by primarily using the DOS command line.</p>
<p>I brought my computer with me when I went to college in 1991, but I also used the computers in the college's library. I don't know what kind of computers these were, but what I really liked about them was that they had WordPerfect 5.1. Like the word processors we have today, I didn't use the vast majority of the functions WP 5.1 offered, but what I liked about it was that, like all DOS-based applications at the time, its interface was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Wordperfect-5.1-dos.png">minimal</a>. I felt comfortable and at home in that DOS minimalism, and have never stopped seeking or recreating it since.</p>
<p>My Tandy stopped booting sometime around 1994 or so, and I graduated at the end of 1995. I went several years without my own computer, but in 1998 I started working for a company and had to use a computer with Windows 95, and then later I bought my next computer, which had Windows 98.</p>
<p>The graphical user interface was entirely new to me, and I hated how busy it was. In the early 2000s, it occurred to me that it would be nice to install WP 5.1 on my computer so that I could have that full screen, single application interface that I found so appealing. By this time, it was already too late. WP 5.1 was gone, but in my search, I found other ways to recreate a minimal writing experience when I found <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/">Emacs</a>, and then <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vim_(text_editor)">Vi/Vim</a>, and of course, Linux. It's now been about 16 years since I first installed Linux.</p>
<p>The computing world had only grown more complicated and busy, but I still like to keep it as simple as I can. I use the <a href="https://i3wm.org/">i3</a> window manager, after having used <a href="https://www.nongnu.org/ratpoison/">ratpoison</a> for years. I practically live in the terminal, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bash_(Unix_shell)">Bash</a>, Vim, and <a href="http://www.mutt.org/">Mutt</a> are my primary applications. If I could only use <a href="http://w3m.sourceforge.net/">w3m</a> all of the time, I'd be even happier.</p>
