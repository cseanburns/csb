				<h1>Teaching</h1>
				
				<p>I regularly teach the courses listed below.</p>
				
				<p>I have written text books for these five courses (links below).
				These works were originally based on my lectures and demonstrations.
				I view them as living documents that are subject to ongoing revision to improve clarity and
				to reflect new knowledge and technological developments.
				They will most often be revised during the periods leading up to an during the semesters when the courses are taught.</p>.
