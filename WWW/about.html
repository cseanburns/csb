    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>I am an <a href="https://ci.uky.edu/sis/users/sean-burns">associate
    professor of information science</a> at the University of Kentucky, where
    I teach in the library science and information, communication, and
    technology programs. My research interests include scholarly communication,
    information retrieval, and academic libraries.</p>

    <h2>Bio</h2>

    <p>I grew up in San Antonio, TX. I attended a bunch of public schools, and
    then left at 18 to go to college at Monmouth College upon the advice and
    with the encouragement of my high school English teacher, Ms. Bailey, and
    also encouraged by Ms. Carr and Mrs. Archer (to all the great teachers out
    there). A shout out to my swim coach, Coach Moreno, too, who motivated me
    to do better all the time. Monmouth was a great experience and I had
    wonderful professors. I still think of them fondly: Drs. Cathey, Suda, Li,
    Watson, Willhardt, McNamara, and McMillan. I've not been in touch with any
    of my high school teachers or most of my college professors in decades, but
    they are always with me.</p>

    <p>After college, some life happened, and instead of going to graduate
    school like I thought I might, I started to work in restaurants full time.
    I began to cook in restaurants in high school and did some of that work in
    college, and felt comfortable in that space. I cooked (mostly) but also
    waited tables and tended bar in about 21 restaurants overall (counting the
    jobs in H.S. and onward). I worked in all types of places: started in fast
    food, but I also worked in a diner, a truck stop, a dive bar, various
    casual places, and one fine dining Italian restaurant in the Seattle area.
    I moved around a lot---something like 7 states and well over twice as many
    cities/towns.</p>

    <p>I decided to apply to grad school and started that in 2007. This was
    also a great experience. My intention was to become a librarian, but I was
    encouraged to apply to the PhD program. I think I would have enjoyed
    pursuing librarianship as a long-term career, but I am glad that I did the
    PhD. I've been at UK since 2013. It's not always an easy or enjoyable job.
    I think I'm still a line cook in my heart and the different cultures
    (restaurant and academia) create a kind of mental tension for me, but it's
    a rewarding profession, for the most part, and I'm pretty fortunate, for
    that and for other things (like my family, which I never imagined I'd ever
    have!).</p>
