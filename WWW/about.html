<h1>About</h1>

<p>I work as an
<a href="https://ci.uky.edu/sis/users/sean-burns">associate professor of information science</a>
at the University of Kentucky, where
I teach in the library science and
the information, communication, and technology programs.</p>

<p>My research interests broadly include scholarly communication,
information retrieval, and academic libraries.
A bit more specifically, some of the topics I have explored include
bias in peer review, health information retrieval, megajournals,
reference librarianship, qualitative methodology, fake news,
tacit knowledge, open science, history of library automation,
and electronic resources.</p>

<p>I use quantitative and qualitative methodologies
but have also published some historical and philosophical work.
More information about my research is available on
<a href="WWW/research.html">my research topics page</a>
and my
<a href="WWW/my-plain-text-social-science.html">research workflow page</a>,

<h2>Bio</h2>

<p>I grew up in San Antonio, Texas and
left for Monmouth College, Monmouth, Illinois upon
the advice and encouragement of a 
<a href="WWW/index.html#high-school">high school English teacher</a>.
Monmouth was a great experience with wonderful professors.</p> 

<p>Some life happened after college, and
instead of attending graduate school,
I started to work in restaurants full time.
I had cooked in some restaurants in
high school and in college,
and I felt comfortable in that space.
I also waited tables and tended bar, and
I ended up working in about 21 restaurants overall.
I worked in fast food, a diner, a truck stop, a dive bar,
various casual places, and
one fine dining Italian restaurant in the Seattle area.
I moved around a lot---something like seven states and
well over twice as many cities/towns.</p>

<p>I applied to graduate school and started in 2007.
While in school,
I worked as a reference librarian and
later a cataloger at a small liberal arts college.
I intended to work as a librarian but
was encouraged to apply to the PhD program.
I think I would have enjoyed librarianship
as a long-term career, but
I am glad that I did the PhD.</p>

<p>I've been at the University of Kentucky since 2013.
It can be a rewarding and also a frustrating profession,
but I feel privileged and fortunate to do it.
I feel more fortunate for some other things,
like my family, which I never imagined I'd have and
which started later in life for me.</p>

<p>Thanks for visiting.</p>
