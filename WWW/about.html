    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>I am an <a href="https://ci.uky.edu/sis/users/sean-burns">associate
    professor of information science</a> at the University of Kentucky, where
    I teach in the library science and information, communication, and
    technology programs. My research interests include scholarly communication,
    information retrieval, and academic libraries.</p>

    <h2>Bio</h2>

    <p>I grew up in San Antonio, Texas and left for Monmouth College in
    Illinois upon the advice and encouragement of a high school English
    teacher. Monmouth was a great experience. I had wonderful professors, and
    I still think of them fondly.</p>

    <p>Some life happened after college, and instead of going to graduate
    school like I thought I might, I started to work in restaurants full time.
    I cooked in restaurants in high school and some in college, and felt
    comfortable in that space. I also waited tables and tended bar and ended up
    working in about 21 restaurants overall (counting the jobs in H.S. and
    onward). I worked in fast food, a diner, a truck stop, a dive bar, various
    casual places, and one fine dining Italian restaurant in the Seattle area.
    I moved around a lot---something like 7 states and well over twice as many
    cities/towns.</p>

    <p>I applied to graduate school and started in 2007. My intention was to
    become a librarian, but I was encouraged to apply to the PhD program.
    I think I would have enjoyed pursuing librarianship as a long-term career,
    but I am glad that I did the PhD. I've been at the University of Kentucky
    since 2013. It's not always an easy or enjoyable job. I think I am a line
    cook at heart, and the different cultures (restaurant and academia) create
    a kind of mental tension for me. However, it's a rewarding profession for
    the most part, and I'm pretty fortunate for it and for other things (like
    my family, which I never imagined I'd ever have!).</p>

    <p>Thanks for visiting.</p>
