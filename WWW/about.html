<h1>About</h1>

<p>I work as an
<a href="https://ci.uky.edu/sis/users/sean-burns">associate professor of information science</a>
at the University of Kentucky, where I teach in the library science (LIS) and the information, communication, and technology (ICT) programs.</p>

<p>My research interests broadly include scholarly communication, information retrieval, and academic libraries.
Some of the topics I have explored include
scholarly communication, scientometrics, and citation analysis;
information retrieval and search systems;
reference librarianship and qualitative methodology studies;
technology and automation in libraries;
library and information science education, open educational resources, and pedagogy; and
fake news, misinformation, and communication studies.</p>

<p>I use quantitative and qualitative methodologies but have also published some historical and philosophical work.
More information about my research is available on my research
<a href="WWW/research.html">topic page</a> and
<a href="NOTES/ESSAYS/my-plain-text-social-science.html">workflow page</a>,

<h2>Bio</h2>

<p>I grew up in the southeast side of San Antonio, Texas and
left for Monmouth College, Monmouth, Illinois upon the advice and encouragement of a 
<a href="WWW/index.html#high-school">high school English teacher</a>.
Monmouth was a great experience with wonderful professors.
I began as a declared double major in English and Computer Science.
Then I took a philosophy course and dropped the CS major for a major in philosophy and religious studies.
That did not go well with some family members.</p>

<p>Some life happened after college, and instead of attending graduate school, I started to work in restaurants full time.
I ended up working in about 21 restaurants overall, mostly as a cook but also as a server, bartender, and front manager.
I worked in fast food, a diner, a truck stop, a dive bar, a bistro, a steakhouse, various other casual places, and
one fine dining Italian restaurant in the Seattle area.
I moved around a lot&mdash;something like seven states and well over twice as many cities/towns.</p>

<p>Eventually I applied to graduate school, which I started in 2007.
I worked as a reference librarian and as a cataloger at a small liberal arts college and
built a digital library of nearly 40,000 photos for a photojournalism institute.
I describe that process on this site:
<a href="NOTES/building-the-poyi-archive.html">Building the POYi Archive</a>.
I intended to work as an academic librarian but was encouraged to apply to the PhD program.
I completed that in May 2013.</p>

<p>I started at the University of Kentucky in 2013.
I feel privileged and fortunate to do work as a professor.
I feel more fortunate to have my children.
I never imagined I'd have such beautiful souls in my life.</p>

<p>Thanks for visiting.</p>

<h2>Site Info</h2>

<h3>Automating this Website</h3>

<p>I wrote what might be called an eccentric <code>bash</code> script to automate site publishing and deploying to
<a href="WWW/index.html">The Text</a>,
which is a single page of mostly short posts on a range of topics.
I describe the beginnings of that script at
<a href="WWW/automation.html">Site Automation w/ Scripts</a>.</p>

<h3>Site Technology</h3>

<p>This site uses only HTML and CSS and is coded in
<a href="https://www.vim.org/">/usr/bin/vim</a>,
although some posts in <em>The Text</em> are written in
<a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/ed/">/usr/bin/ed</a>.</p>

<p>Outside of being hosted on GitHub, this site does not include any additional analytics.</p>
