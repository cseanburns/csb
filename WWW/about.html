    <h2>About</h2>

    <p>I am an <a href="https://ci.uky.edu/sis/users/sean-burns">associate
    professor of information science</a> at the University of Kentucky, where
    I teach in the library science program and the information, communication,
    and technology program.</p>

    <p>My research interests broadly include scholarly communication,
    information retrieval, and academic libraries. A bit more specifically,
    some of the topics I have explored include the history of library
    automation, reference librarianship, scholarly writing, megajournals, peer
    review, data sharing, qualitative methodologies, tacit knowledge, and
    information retrieval.</p>

    <p>I use quantitative and qualitative methodologies but have also published
    some historical and philosophical work. More information is available at
    the following sites (and the link to my CV is at the top of this page):</p>

<h2>Bio</h2>

<p>I grew up in San Antonio, Texas and left for Monmouth College, Monmouth,
Illinois upon the advice and encouragement of a high school English teacher.
Monmouth was a great experience with wonderful professors.</p> 

<p>Some life happened after college, and instead of attending graduate school,
I started to work in restaurants full time. I had cooked in some restaurants in
high school and in college, and I felt comfortable in that space. I also waited
tables and tended bar, and I ended up working in about 21 restaurants overall.
I worked in fast food, a diner, a truck stop, a dive bar, various casual
places, and one fine dining Italian restaurant in the Seattle area. I moved
around a lot---something like seven states and well over twice as many
cities/towns.</p>

<p>I applied to graduate school and started in 2007. While in school, I worked
as a reference librarian and later a cataloger at a small liberal arts college.
I intended to work as a librarian but was encouraged to apply to the PhD
program. I think I would have enjoyed librarianship as a long-term career, but
I am glad that I did the PhD.</p>

<p>I've been at the University of Kentucky since 2013. It can be a rewarding and also a frustrating
profession, but I feel privileged and fortunate to do it. I feel more fortunate for some other things, like my family, which I never imagined I'd have and which started later in life for me.</p>
